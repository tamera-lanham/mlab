       " {'text': \"First of all, I am not a utilitarian. I'm doing this because I think it is valuable to see how different moral intuitions connect to each other, and it's also fun.\\xa0My argument is based on the following claims:Is claim: A person’s pleasure/pain can be quantified and compared to another person’s pleasure/pain.\\xa0Ought claim 1: A person ought to follow the laws of rational choice theory.Ought claim 2: A person's decisions ought to only be informed by how they affect the pain/pleasure of other people and themselves.Ought claim 3: If a person's decision only affects themself, they ought to increase their own pleasure.Ought claim 4: Morality treats everyone the same. More precisely, a person ought to make the same decision if they knew they would switch places with another person afterward.\\xa0Ought claim 5: The fairness of an outcome ought to be irrelevant (this is probably the most interesting and contentious assumption).In its present form, this argument only applies to universes where there are two people living in them. It could probably be generalized to n people, but I haven't had time to look into this.Here is the setup:There are two people in a room. Person 1 can choose to take an apple or a banana. Whatever person 1 decides not to take is given to person 2. I will prove that person A should make their decision based on total hedonistic utilitarianism, which I make more clear in a moment.Obviously, there is nothing special about this apple-banana conundrum. You can apply the reasoning I am going to give to any decision which affects two people.Is claim: A person’s pleasure/pain can be quantified and compared to another person’s pleasure/pain. Here's what person 1's pleasure axis might look like for different experiences:There are 4 pleasure/pain numbers involved in this scenario:\\xa0The pleasure of person 1 when they get an apple (A1)The pleasure of person 2 when they get a banana (B2)The pleasure of person 1 when they get a banana (B1)The pleasure of person 2 when they get an apple (A2)I will show that if:A1+B2>B1+A2Then person 1 ought to take the apple. Otherwise, they ought to take the banana.Ought claim 2: A person's decisions ought to only be informed by how they affect the pain/pleasure of other people and themselves.This implies that person 1's decision should only depend on A1, B2, B1, and A2. Let's define a function:d:(A1,B2,B1,A2)→'choose apple' or 'choose banana'Ought claim 1: A person ought to follow the laws of rational choice theory.By the\\xa0Von Neumann–Morgenstern utility theorem, this implies that there exists a function:u:S→Rthat assigns a number to a scenario that represents person 1’s preference for that scenario. Person 1 will choose scenario s1 over scenario s2 when u(s1) > u(s2).There are two scenarios that person 1 must decide between:\\xa0By ought claim 2, the only thing that is relevant here is pleasure and pain. So, u is a function of x and y where x is the pleasure of person 1 and y is the pleasure of person 2.Writing this in math:d(A1,B2,A2,B1)='choose apple'⟺u(A1,B2)>u(B1,A2)d(A1,B2,A2,B1)='choose banana'⟺u(A1,B2)<u(B1,A2)\\xa0Ought claim 4: Morality treats everyone the same. More precisely, a person ought to make the same decision if they know they would switch places with another person afterward.\\xa0Person 1 shouldn't care about the distinction between themself and person 2, which means that:u(x,y)=u(y,x)\\xa0for all\\xa0x,yTherefore, there exists a function g such that:u(x,y)=g(|x−y|,x+y)This can be shown by using a rotated and scaled coordinate system, parameterized by:u=x−y\\xa0and\\xa0v=x+yu(x,y)=g(u,v)=g(x−y,x+y)=u(y,x)⟹g(x−y,x+y)=g(|x−y|,x+y)\\xa0Let’s take a step back and think about what this result means.\\xa0|x - y| is the amount by which person 1 and person 2’s pleasure differ. This is similar to the concept of\\xa0fairness\\xa0or\\xa0justice.\\xa0 x + y is the sum of their pleasures. This means that person 1’s decision ought to only depend on the fairness of the result and the total pleasure produced.This is a surprisingly good model of common moral intuitions.Let's finish the proof.Ought claim 5: The fairness of an outcome ought to be irrelevant.This is by far the most contentious claim, but I can't see a way around it. Let me know in the comments if you can think of a more agreeable axiom that would complete the proof.More formally, this implies that there exists a function h such that:u(x,y)=g(|x−y|,x+y)=h(x+y)We are almost done.Ought claim 3: If a decision affects no one but yourself, you ought to increase your own pleasure.This means that if y is held fixed, then u(x,y) ought to be higher if x is higher:x1>x2⟹u(x1,y)>u(x2,y)\\xa0for all\\xa0yTherefore, h is monotonic increasing:x1>x2⟺x1+y>x2+y⟹h(x1+y)>h(x2+y)\\xa0for all\\xa0yBringing back the original definition of u(x,y) and using the fact that h is monotonic increasing:d(A1,B2,A2,B1)='choose apple'⟺u(A1,B2)>u(B1,A2)⟺h(A1+B2)>h(B1+A2)⟺A1+B2>B1+A2So person 1 ought to choose the apple if A1 + B2 > B1 + A2. That's total utilitarianism. QED.\\xa0\",\n",

       " {'text': 'I\\'ve been wondering about this question for a while, but some new research released today reminded me of it:\\n\\nThe seasonal timing of the catastrophic end-Cretaceous bolide impact places the event at a particularly sensitive stage for biological life cycles in the Northern Hemisphere. In many taxa, annual reproduction and growth take place during spring. Species with longer incubation times, such as non-avian reptiles, including pterosaurs and most dinosaurs, were arguably more vulnerable to sudden environmental perturbations than other groups43 (for example, birds).\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, large-scale wildfires raging across the Southern Hemisphere9,34,41 may have been evaded by hibernating mammals that were already sheltered in burrows34,41 in anticipation of austral winter. Additional modes of seasonal dormancy, torpor and/or aestivation, which are nowadays practised by various mammals46,47 as well as certain amphibians, birds and crocodilians48, could have facilitated further underground survival.\\n\\nThe article speculates that the particular time of year at which the asteroid struck is responsible for the pattern of extinctions that resulted. I have also heard it suggested (don\\'t remember where) that the particular location of the impact - in shallow water just off the coast - had a different effect than if it had hit either on land or in the deep sea (i.e. the large majority of Earth\\'s surface). And it seems somewhat odd that an impact of that size should\\'ve occurred in the so recent past:\\n\\nImpacts of asteroids spanning more than 10 kilometers are rare and happen about every 250 to 500 million years. Having one such event only 66 million years ago is therefore mildly special.\\n\\nIs the peculiarity of the K-T event yet another example of \"fine-tuning\" explained by the anthropic principle?\\nConsider (reposting from before) the fossil evidence of the progression in intelligence over time:\\n\\n\\nThe first chart shows the encephalization quotient (EQ) of various lineages over time, while the second shows the maximum EQ of all known fossils from any given time.\\nThis suggests that the Mesozoic was a long period of stagnation in the development of intelligence on Earth, and that if the K-T event had not occurred, it would\\'ve been unlikely for human-level intelligence ever to have evolved, whether from the mammalian or the reptilian lineages.\\nWhen we think about the likelihood of intelligence evolving, it\\'s tempting to look at a particular species or lineage in isolation; but really this is missing the forest for the trees, because evolution is a response to a changing environment, a large portion of which consists of the other species in the ecosystem. Our mouse-like ancestors that survived the K-T event might never have evolved any greater intelligence than that, unless a finely-tuned mass extinction had completely cleared the terrestrial megafauna niche while leaving the burrowers intact. Is that why you\\'re here reading this today?\\nThe answer to this question is not purely academic; it has direct implications for estimating whether we have already passed the Great Filter.\\nI know next to nothing about paleontology or evolution, just what I\\'ve learned from skimming a few articles.

       " {'text': 'When a person first begins to study naturalism with me, I say to them almost nothing that I’ve written in this sequence.\\xa0That might very well be a mistake; I might get better results if I knew some short combination of words that would cause them to correctly understand, intellectually, what we are doing and why, before we started.But in fact I bank on the person’s trust in me a bit, and begin by helping them establish consistent habits of observation.\\xa0If they’re interested in studying confusion, I ask them to tap their leg every time they notice they’re confused. I ask them to keep a log book in which they record a few words about their experiences of confusion each day. I ask them to make predictions about what it will be like to notice confusion—what kind of situation will be happening and how they will know in the moment that they are confused—and to compare their observations to their predictions.And then, throughout what has so far proven to be about a three month program, I never shift our focus away from consistent habits of observation. It’s not just where I start. It’s the entire curriculum.From a practical perspective, this dogged persistence is the foundation of naturalism. “Direct observation of the territory”, without patience, gets you something like a bag of tricks. Valuable tricks, but still tricks. Isolated mental motions made when they are convenient and enjoyable, not when they are most needed.With patience, though, you get a life-long practice of epistemic rationality.So the whole naturalism program, from start to finish, consists of the establishment, improvement, and maintenance of consistent habits of observation. Consistent and ceaseless, without any sense that “and then we’ll be done observing and get back to normal”. When my students and I meet, we are constantly talking about what daily practice looked like over the past week, what was too heavy to implement as a regular routine, and how they personally can slow down enough to thoroughly observe. We continue in this way until they no longer seem to need me to ask those questions for them. The program is meant to introduce a new normal.The rest of what I talk about in this sequence is sprinkled in, sure. It\\'s implicit in the questions I ask, the approaches I encourage, and \"my whole vibe\". Like a catalyst, or like spices, those other parts are crucial to the recipe. But patience is the engine that makes all of it go. None of what I’ve written here gets off the ground unless it is practiced as an ongoing discipline.I suspect that the thing I’m calling “patience” really is a single core capacity, or a single virtue; but it can express itself in multiple patterns of behavior. I’d like to talk about three patient behavior patterns: tenacity, openness, and thoroughness.In my mind, the paradigmatic example of tenacity is marathon training. Not marathon racing, but the training program a runner goes through to prepare for their first marathon.After an initial adjustment period, training for endurance athletics is mainly difficult because it requires commitment to the maintenance of a routine, not because it requires intense exertion. Most of the time you’re not running anywhere near as fast as you can, and at least until race day, you’re not running as far as you can either. On any given day, you’re running a comfortable-for-you amount—but you’re doing it day after day after day, without fail, for months at a time. The distance running motto is “small, consistent efforts”.The facet of patience I’m calling tenacity is the ability to exert small, consistent efforts.The reason tenacity is foundational to naturalism is that it’s required for any kind of maintenance. Knowledge of the territory requires not just contact with the territory, but maintenance of that contact. Bumping up against the world and bouncing right back off again is not enough; you have to reliably return after you bounce.We are bound to see things as we are, rather than as they are; but we are not bound to always see them as we were when we first encountered them. It is possible to observe again, and again, and again; if you do that with naked directness, and with the relentlessness of marathon training, your perceptual systems will inevitably adjust to perceive reality more accurately over time.\\xa0The next facet of patience I’d like to talk about is “openness”, in the sense of “non-closure”.When someone comes to me for advice on a long-standing adaptive challenge, the most common recommendation I give is, “Stop trying to solve this problem for a while. Start investigating the underlying territory instead.”I recently chatted with someone who was worried that she might be a narcissist, and wanted to know what to do about it. She gave me permission to share these (anonymized) excerpts from our conversation.Logan: my first thought is that this sounds like a situation where you\\'d do well to put \"what should i do about it?\" on hold for a good three months, and focus instead on \"what is actually happening? how can i tell? what is it like? what is my brain doing by default in various situations, and which situations are the ones i care about here? which phenomena and mental motions seem important for understanding what\\'s happening here?\"Crystal: That seems smart. But, seems better to know I am a narcissist than to be uncertain about it for three months... more comfortable I meanLogan: i imagine that you have a question like \"am i a narcissist?\" in your head, and it\\'s really salient because things you care about depend on the answer to it, and it\\'s uncomfortable to not know the answer because you\\'d ideally orient to the two different worlds differently, and when you don\\'t know which you\\'re in you don’t\\' know how to orient. is that right?Crystal: YeahHere, Crystal is demonstrating a need for closure. She is uncomfortable (understandably!) with being uncertain. She would like to make plans for the future. Those plans may be substantially different in worlds where she believes the answer to the question \"am I a narcissist?\" is \"yes\" than in the world where it\\'s \"no.\" She wants to know what to work on, in herself and in her relationships. She wants to know what to expect.So when I recommend to her that she deliberately hang out in uncertainty while she gradually increases her contact with the territory, it feels bad to her.Back to the conversation, jumping ahead a bit:Logan: i tend to operate under the conjecture that when there is a thing that\\'s been a problem for most of a person\\'s life, that person\\'s way of conceptualizing the problem is very likely to be incorrect or incomplete in ways that make investigation that\\'s not driven by the concept more productive than investigation that is driven by the concept.Crystal: The concept being “narcissism”?Logan: yeah.Crystal: How is it driven by the concept or not? What does that mean?Logan: investigation that\\'s driven by the concept looks like: how would i know if i\\'m a narcissist? what things are evidence for or against? where would i look for evidence of narcissism? what would disconfirming evidence look like? what are alternative hypotheses? how might i test them?Crystal: > investigation that\\'s driven by the concept looks like: how would i know …That sounds like meLogan: investigation that\\'s not driven by the concept might look like: what does it feel like to be worried about whether i\\'m a narcissist? what seems to be at stake? if i go through the week and write down times when something related to the-thing-i-care-about-here happened, what do i end up writing? what was happening around me and in my head during those times? which of the things happening in my experience seems most closely tied to the-thing-i-care-about-here? how can i tell when that thing is happening in my head? if i watch for times when that thing is happening in my head and write down instances, what do i write?in other words, it\\'s possible to gain a lot of information about what\\'s actually going on without having pre-decided most of what\\'s going on. my suspicion is that this is a time when it makes sense to not pre-decide most of what\\'s going on before you try to really seriously get in contact with the relevant region of territoryI often call the latter type of investigation—the kind that’s not driven by the concept—”exploratory investigation”. I’ve never used a word for the former type, but here I’m inclined to dub it “certainty seeking”.Certainty seeking is often the right approach. It’s the right approach when you have good reason to think you mostly understand the situation and just need to fill in some details, or to determine the truth values of a couple central propositions. In that case, a more exploratory investigation style would be needlessly inefficient.But people very often fall into certainty seeking when they are impatient. They already have a sketch, and for one reason or another, they just want to fill in the details and be done. They’re willing to shift a line here or there, but mainly they’re motivated to complete the drawing. “All I want to know is, is this narcissism or isn’t it? Yes or no?!”A person in the grips of this impatient mode is not so much trying to learn the shape of reality, as to crystalize a satisfying concept so they can relax into certainty.There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, of course. My point is that nearly all truth-seeking benefits from a combined approach to investigation. You need to be able to move back and forth. Impatience tends to crowd out direct exploration, and ensures that you’ll mainly find whatever you have already decided to look for.Openness, in the sense I mean, is the ability to observe without desperation for an answer.But, what is it to observe without desperation? I’ve told you what this facet of patience lacks, but what does it consist of?Today I saw a raven do a barrel roll[1].\\xa0I’d heard that ravens could turn over in the air, and even do backflips occasionally, and I’d seen pictures of ravens upside down. But when I saw this one do a barrel roll right in front of me—well, above me, I suppose—I felt… “surprise” is too simple. I felt glued to the ground, knocked sideways, and opened up all at once. I felt awe. I shouted up to the raven, “You just did a barrel roll! What?! That was awesome! You are awesome!”Before I saw the raven, I was out on a walk through the country, down a dirt road with a few houses and lots of trees. Earlier on my walk, I took a picture of some kind of insect nest, or perhaps a fungus, on the underside of a leaf. I peered through a hedge to see if I could work out what kind of crop my secretive neighbors were growing. I smelled some little pink flowers on a tree and found that their scent was a lot like caramel and roses mixed with grass. I pet a dog and asked her if she could smell my cat (which she probably could, but she wasn’t feeling chatty). I learned that the acorn hats have dried out enough to go “crunch” underfoot.\\xa0My state of mind was one of open, gentle exploration. And it’s from that state of mind that the raven was able to move me in the way it did.I can imagine an alternate walk in which I was trying to determine whether or not my local ravens can do aerial acrobatics. I think there would have been some frustration with the many ravens I saw along the way who were not even flying, let alone flying upside down. (I wouldn’t have observed any leaf bottoms at all.) And I think that seeing the barrel roll would still have been very cool, but it also would have felt a lot more like relief and completion; like the end of something, rather than the beginning. Like closing, more than like opening.But more importantly, I never would have set out on such a walk in the first place. It simply would never have occurred to me. I saw a raven do a barrel roll because I was there when it happened. I was in the right place, and I was open.Openness feels like being there for whatever happens. Being down.\\xa0It\\'s almost-but-not-quite the opposite of purposefulness. It\\'s the canvas on which purposes get painted. A central strategy of naturalism is to put most of your purposefulness points into choosing where to bring your canvas. If that canvas is already full, then there\\'s nowhere for new and surprising things to land.\\xa0Openness feels like putting myself in the middle of something alive, looking around, and letting whatever I observe move me however it does.The final facet of patience I’d like to discuss is thoroughness.When I think of thoroughness, I imagine holding a puzzle box as I turn it around and around, trying to visually examine it from all angles. No matter how accurate and precise my observations of the box from one particular angle, it is only possible to see at most three faces of a cube from any single vantage point. To know the whole surface of a cube, I either have to move the cube, or I have to move myself.If the puzzle box is sitting on your desk, and you glance over at it several times as you go about your day, you’ll most likely catch it from a few different angles by accident. So tenacity and openness together naturally result in some amount of thoroughness.This is the principle behind what Anna Salamon has called “the 50/50 rule”. According to (my own interpretation of) the 50/50 rule, 50% of the intellectual progress you make on something will happen while you are deliberately trying to make progress on that thing in particular. The other 50% will happen while you are engaged with other things: riding the bus, playing with your kids, designing a board game, identifying a bird.\\xa0It’s important to spend a lot of your time doing things other than focusing on your Main Project. This is not just because your brain needs to “rest”; it is also important to do other things because you will see different faces of the puzzle box while you are dancing at a salsa club than while you are staring at a white board.It is possible to find additional vantage points on purpose, and I call this capacity “perceptual dexterity”.When I look at the pen that is on my desk right now, I see a pen. That is, when I direct my gaze and attention toward the part of my visual field where light is reflecting off the surface of the pen, my concept of “pen” is active.When I see the pen as a pen, certain parts of my experience stand out to me, while others are discarded. My attention lands on the button at the top, which I could push to extrude the nib. It lands on the thin cylindrical shape, and I can feel myself preparing to orient my hand to that shape in a way that would allow me to hold the pen for writing.\\xa0But the reflection of the clip in the shiny metal surface of the cylinder doesn’t occur to me, when I see the pen as a pen. To notice that reflection, I have to see the pen a little differently than I would by default. I have to rotate to a slightly different vantage point—to rotate my mind into a slightly different configuration, one that processes information a bit differently.I don’t have to primarily activate my “pen” concept just because I happen to be looking at a pen. I can choose to rotate my mind however I want, and then look at the thing in front of me.\\xa0If I rotate my mind toward “goose”, what first stands out to me is the hole in the front, which seems to break an otherwise aerodynamic nose. Maybe the air would get stuck in there, if this pen had wings and tried to fly.If I rotate toward “aggression”, the first thing that stands out is the place where the clip is attached to the body of the pen, as I evaluate its thickness and wonder how much force it would take to snap the clip off and leave a sharp edge.When I’m chewing on a problem and feeling a little stuck, one of the first things I do is ask myself, “If this were a boat, what sort of boat would it be?” There’s nothing special about boats for problem solving, but answering this question forces me to rotate my mind into a configuration that is probably quite different from whatever I was stuck in before. If this pen were a boat, it would be a sleek but sturdy racing boat with a silver sail and an athletic captain steering.The more perceptually dexterous you are, the less constrained you are to see only what you saw in your very first glance. You are not trapped in your most familiar perspective.\\xa0Thoroughness is what results from the successful exercise of perceptual dexterity. It is observation that continues well beyond familiarity, traversing many vantage points to triangulate reality.The thing that tenacity, openness, and thoroughness have in common is what I mean by “patience”. It’s the opposite of “rushing”, the opposite of “just wanting to be done”, or the opposite of “jumping to conclusions”. Patience is taking the time to discover the real shape of the world.By “patient observation”, then, I mean observation that is tenacious, open, and thorough. Knowing the territory requires direct observation that takes its time to discover the shape of the world.^It was technically an aileron roll.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Based on work done with Rebecca Gorman and Oliver Daniel-Koch.\\nIn a previous post, I talked about GPT-3 and symbol grounding. This post presents a simpler example where GPT-3 fails (and succeeds) at grounding its symbols.\\nUndead workers\\nThe following text was presented to the Open AI beta playground (using the \"text-davinci-001\" option):\\n\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Monday the 1st, she went to work at the office.\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Tuesday the 2nd, she went to work at the office.\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Wednesday the 3rd, she went to work at the office.\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Thursday the 4th, she went to work at the office.\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Friday the 5th, she went to work at the office.\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Saturday the 6th,\\n\\nGPT-3 fell straight into the obvious trap, completing it as:\\n\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Saturday the 6th, she went to work at the office.\\n\\nTurning on the \"Show probabilities: full spectrum\" option, we saw that the probability of that completion was over 99.7%. Sometimes GPT-3 would extend it further, adding:\\n\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Sunday the 7th, she went to work at the office.\\n\\nSo, the undead woman continued at her job, assiduous to the last - and beyond.\\nTo check that GPT-3 \"knew\" that dead people didn\\'t work, we asked it directly:\\n\\nCan people who die go to work at the office?\\nThere is no evidence that people who die go to work at the office.\\n\\nUndead repetitive workers on the weekend\\nThe above results show that simple repetitive prompts can cause GPT-3 to make stupid mistakes. Therefore GPT-3 doesn\\'t \\'understand\\' the word \"died\" - that symbol isn\\'t grounded, right?\\nBut the situation gets more complicated if change the prompt, removing all but the first mention of her dying:\\n\\nShe died on Friday the 5th. On Monday the 1st, she went to work at the office.\\nOn Tuesday the 2nd, she went to work at the office.\\nOn Wednesday the 3rd, she went to work at the office.\\nOn Thursday the 4th, she went to work at the office.\\nOn Friday the 5th, she went to work at the office.\\nOn Saturday the 6th,\\n\\nFor that prompt \"she went to work at the office\" was still the most common completion. But it only happened about 43% of the time. Alternatively, GPT-3 sometimes found the completion \"she was found dead\". Kudos, GPT-3, you understand the prompt after all! That completion came up about 34% of the time.\\nWhat other completions were possible? The shorter \"she died\" came up 11% of the time - medium points, GPT-3, you understood that her death was relevant, but you got the day wrong.\\nBut there was one other avenue that GPT-3 could follow; the following had a joint probability of around 11%:\\n\\nshe stayed home.\\nshe stayed at home.\\nshe stayed in bed.\\nshe did not go to work.\\n\\nThis seems to be a clear pattern of GPT-3 realising that Saturday was different where work was concerned. There is certainly a lot of weekend holidaying in its training set.\\nSo there are three patterns competing within GPT-3 when it tries to complete this text. The first is the purely syntactic repetition: do another sentence that follows the simple pattern of the sentences above. The second is the one which \"realises\" that death on Friday changes things for Saturday. And the third is the one which \"realises\" that the weekend is different from the week, at least where work is concerned.\\nIn the very first example, when we had \"She died on Friday the 5th\" in front of each line, this massively reinforced the \"repetition\" pattern. So, mentioning that she died, again and again, resulted in her death being completely ignored by GPT-3.\\nWe can similarly reinforce the other patterns. Adding \"It\\'s the weekend!\" in front of the last line increased the probability of \"she stayed home\". Moving \"She died on Friday the 5th\" from the first line to the last, increased the probability of all the death-related completions. So all three patterns are competing to complete it.\\nSome small level of understanding\\nI\\'d say that the above shows that GPT-3 has some level of understanding of the meaning of words - but not a lot. It doesn\\'t fully grasp what\\'s going on, but neither is it completely clueless.\\nHere is another example of GPT-3 failing to grasp the situation. In the \"Q&A\" mode, the following question was asked:\\n\\nQ: You are in a two dimensional 3x3 gridworld, in the middle square, facing north. You can issue four command, \"N\" to move north, \"S\" to move south, \"E\" to move east, and \"W\" to move West. You want the treasure. It is located to your left, behind you.\\nWhat commands should you issue?\\\\\\n\\nSo the setup, as described, is this one:\\n\\nThe exchange with GPT-3 went like this:\\n\\nQ: You are in a two dimensional 3x3 gridworld, in the middle square, facing north. You can issue four command, \"N\" to move north, \"S\" to move south, \"E\" to move east, and \"W\" to move West. You want the treasure. It is located to your left, behind you.\\nWhat commands should you issue?\\nA: N, S, E, W\\nQ: That is incorrect. Try again.\\nA: N, S, W, E\\nQ: Still incorrect. Try again.\\nA: N, E, S, W\\nQ: That\\'s worse. Try again.\\nA: N, E, W, S\\nQ: Only two commands are needed. Try again.\\nA: N, S\\nQ: Still failing. Try again.\\nA: N, E, W\\n\\nSo, GPT-3 \\'realised\\' that N, S, E, and W were commands, and \\'knew\\' what \"Only two commands are needed\" and \"try again\" meant. But it clearly had no idea of the overall situation.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': '[Epistemic status: Probably true, but very incomplete. I’m just some guy who spent a few days reading studies and literature reviews on this subject. This is just a short look at some of the technical (i.e. non-fundamental; could be solved with better techniques) issues that are encountered in the process of measuring happiness.]Terms and Definitions ApplyThe tradition in scientific literature about happiness seems to be to start by mentioning how much we humans care about happiness. Far be it from me to break tradition, so: obviously, we care a lot about happiness. It’s the thing most people spend most of their lives trying to attain (either for themselves or for others).Um … how, exactly, do we know we have it, though? It’s not like you can just grab a Happiness Thermometer, stick it up your nose into your brain, and measure how happy you are.Worse yet, people don’t even seem to agree on what happiness is. Aristotle calls it“activity of the soul in conformity with excellence or virtue”,while the psychologist Kahneman defines it as“what I experience here and now”.Modern happiness research by social scientists seeks to incorporate both definitions as aspects of a broader concept of welfare. Much effort has gone into differentiating the two; Huta & Waterman (2014) is the prime example, a valiant attempt at classifying both terms. I will be drawing heavily from this study throughout this post, starting with these definitions:Aristotle’s concept is called eudaimonia, the Greek term he himself used; “good spirit” is a strict translation of the word, but more broadly it means “flourishing”. The core concepts are virtue, identity, meaning and self-actualization. “Psychological well-being” is a synonym often used in the literature.Kahneman’s concept, to keep the Greek vibe going, is called hedonia. Hedonia is about good feelings: pleasure and happiness are core concepts. Many authors add comfort and/or absence of distress. “Subjective well-being” is the corresponding synonym.There’s another important distinction here, between state levels and trait levels.Someone’s state level of hedonia or eudaimonia measures the degree of the relevant concept in a specific moment (how happy you are right now; how virtuous you have been today) while their trait level is their degree of hedonia or eudaimonia throughout their life, like an inherent trait of that person.Having completed the ritual of defining the things we’re speaking about (maybe it would’ve been better to just Taboo the words), we can finally get on to the meat. How do we measure this stuff?Eudaimonia and hedonia are both typically measured by self-report surveys. People are given a survey with statements like “I feel that life is very rewarding” or “I am very happy” and asked to rate how much they agree with the statement on a scale from 0 to X (X usually being 5, 6 or 7). The scientists then take the average of those numbers: there’s your happiness score!Problem #1: Poor MemoryA Famous NumberThis self-report method has been used to produce findings like Deaton & Kahneman (2010)’s $75000 figure (if you haven’t heard of it, don’t worry: countless pop science articles will be happy to explain how “The Price of Happiness [is] $75000”).Of course, all those articles’ headlines are a bit misleading. Why? Because they leave out the other finding that was also in the title of the study: “High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being”.According to the study, emotional well-being (state level hedonia, as measured by questions like “did you feel X emotion yesterday?”) stayed constant above $75000. That wasn’t the only variable being measured, though. They measured life satisfaction (a trait-level correlate of both hedonia and eudaimonia) with one simple question:Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you, and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?Notice how the “Ladder” line, which represents life satisfaction, keeps rising with log income after $80000. The “Positive affect”, “Not blue”, and “Stress free” lines, all different measures of state hedonia, do not.So over $75000/year, people continue to get more life satisfaction, but not more experienced well being / state hedonia. That makes sense, right? I can easily think of an explanation: maybe after $75000, we run out of things we really care about spending money on, and start throwing it at frivolous luxuries that don’t actually make us happier, but our life satisfaction keeps rising because we’re comparing our lives to others’. The authors mention a similar explanation:Perhaps $75,000 is a threshold beyond which further increases in income no longer improve individuals’ ability to do what matters most to their emotional well-being, such as spending time with people they like, avoiding pain and disease, and enjoying leisure.We’ve got our empirical findings and a mechanical explanation for them. Case closed, right? Wrong.Hi there! How are you feeling right now?So what’s the problem here? Well, the study’s authors were a bit out of date. See, Deaton and Kahneman neglected to use the hottest new tech in happiness measurement: experience sampling.Experience sampling is when instead of asking people to report on how they were feeling yesterday or last week, you prompt them with surveys throughout the day to ask them how they’re feeling at that exact moment. This was made possible by the rise of smartphones, which people are carrying with them at every point of the day and always checking. For the researchers, it’s as easy as sending an automated text message a few times per day![1]\\xa0Aside from more thoroughly annoying your test subjects, though, what’s the point of this new method? Well, human memory is notoriously unreliable. We’ve known that ever since Elizabeth Loftus’ countless memory experiments. So there’s no reason to expect our memory of how we were feeling yesterday to be any better.Indeed, there are plenty of studies showing that our memory of emotions is quite fallible. There’s the peak-end rule, first discovered in Kahneman (1993), which states that when remembering an experience, we only really judge its valence on two data points: the peak (the most intense point) and the end.[2]For example, in the Kahneman (1993) study I just mentioned, people judged sticking their hand in painfully cold water for 1 minute, then switching to slightly less cold water for another thirty seconds, less unpleasant than only doing the 1 minute in ice cold water part. It’s the same experience! They just tacked on another painful bit at the end! If anything, people should be judging the longer ice bath worse. The peak-end rule is a form of duration neglect: we don’t really care about how long the experience lasted, just how good or bad it was at certain points.Another one: Breckler (1994) asked blood donors 2, 10, or 49 days after their donation to remember how they felt donating blood. They then compared the memories to surveys taken at the time of donation by some of the subjects. Not only did they find that people remembered their emotions differently depending on their mood while taking the survey, but also (very important!) that donors remembered more anxiety the more time had passed since the donation.That is why we do experience sampling. If you ask people how they feel right that second, there’s no time for the memory goblins to have gotten into their brains and messed up their memories yet. The emotions are still there.So predictably, when someone [Killingsworth (2020)] tried to replicate the $75000 study using experience sampling (and a few other design improvements like including more rich people), the results for experienced well-being - aka state hedonia - were quite different.Line go up means world more happier!This graph clearly shows that even after $75000, experienced well-being continues to rise with log income - that is, doubling your income will increase your happiness by roughly the same amount each time. That makes sense if you consider diminishing marginal utility - your 75001st dollar will increase your happiness a lot less than your 101st, but it isn’t completely useless either.There we are. We’ve found an elegant solution for our memory problems: cut out the memory middleman and just ask people how they’re feeling right now.(An alternative is the Day Reconstruction Method: asking people to write all their experiences of the day in a diary, clearly define the duration of each experience, then evaluate how they felt during each experience. Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz and Stone (2004) show that this method produces basically the same results as experience sampling, implying that it is at least nearly as good; maybe even better. The authors say that this method works because writing down the experiences makes the test subjects relive their feelings in the process of remembering.)Solution #1: Experience Sampling (or Day Reconstruction)Problem #2a: AsymmetryFour Humours Elements CategoriesHuta & Waterman say that, in happiness research, there are four categories of analysis:(a) orientations: orientations, values, motives, and goals(b) behaviors: behavioral content and activity characteristics(c) experiences: subjective experiences, emotions, and cognitive appraisals(d) functioning: indices of positive psychological functioning, mental health, and flourishingA hedonic orientation might be something like “I really value having fun with my friends”, while a eudaimonic orientation could be “I want to focus on self-realization”.An example of a hedonic behavior is eating ice cream with ALL THE TOPPINGS; reading classic literature is a quintessential eudaimonic behavior. Behavior is unique among these four because it can be reliably measured by something besides self-report: other-report. Just ask someone’s parents, friends or spouse what they enjoy doing and bam, you’ve got data!Feeling the tastes of all the strawberry ice cream and chocolate sprinkles and caramel sauce mix on your tongue is a hedonic experience; untangling the metaphor in La Peste or the satire of Max Havelaar is a eudaimonic experience.Finally, there’s functioning. Self-acceptance is an important kind of eudaimonic functioning; as for hedonic functioning, Huta & Waterman say:[N]o measures or theory have been proposed regarding hedonia in the functioning category of analysis. It would be worth contemplating whether there is such a thing as positive hedonic functioning, and what such functioning would look like, or whether the entire notion of positive functioning falls under the concept of eudaimonia.An imbalance in the ForceHuta & Waterman identify an asymmetry here: often within the same study, hedonia will be assessed in terms of cognitive-affective experiences, while eudaimonia is assessed in terms of positive mental functioning or orientations.[This asymmetry originates from the philosophical distinction between eudaimonia and hedonia; note that Aristotle’s definition of eudaimonia refers to “activity of the soul”, aka functioning rather than experience, while Pigou defines hedonia in terms of “states of consciousness” - experience, not functioning.]This makes these concepts harder to study because studies that incorporate this asymmetry might just be measuring differences between positive cognitive-affective experiences and positive mental functioning, rather than differences between hedonia and eudaimonia.And here’s the authors’ explanation of another problem with the asymmetry:Asymmetrical treatment of eudaimonia and hedonia also makes it difficult to directly compare the empirical relationships they have with predictors or outcomes. For example, when studying the links between various predictors and well-being outcomes, and when the aim is to include both eudaimonic and hedonic conceptions of well-being\\xa0outcomes, researchers often operationalize eudaimonia using Ryff’s Scales of Psychological Well-Being (Ryff 1989), which assess eudaimonia in terms of qualities associated with positive psychological functioning; on the other hand, studies often operationalize hedonia using one or more component(s) of subjective well-being (Diener 2000)—positive affect, negative affect, and/or life satisfaction.The example they use is an optimism intervention: say you give your test subjects some self-help books and then make them do team-building exercises while shouting inspirational quotes at them. Then you measure their well-being, and it seems like hedonia improved more than eudaimonia.Now, if you assessed both terms by e.g. experience, there’s no problem here - go publish your results in a journal, watch all the business magazines run articles on it, and soon enough every corporation in America will be running your optimism interventions. Good job!But if you assess hedonia in terms of experience and eudaimonia in terms of functioning, then - well, realistically, the business magazines and corporations will run with it anyway - but the ghost of Thomas Bayes will be very disappointed in you, because you can’t actually be sure that this is a causal effect. There are quite a few possible confounders here; for example, maybe your cognitive state just changes more easily than your psychological functioning!Solution #2a: Use the same analysis categories when comparing thingsProblem #2b: Unclear DefinitionsWho’s that entering the arena? Oh my god, it’s Semantics with a steel chair!You believed me earlier when I said we were done with definitions? HA! We are never done with definitions.In fact, the definitions I posted at the beginning of this post were synthesized by Huta & Waterman in this very same paper. They took a bunch of studies on well-being and looked at the elements included in the definitions in each study. Here’s the table.It’s clear that while there are some concepts everyone considers to be core to eudaimonia and hedonia, there’s also a fair amount of disagreement in the literature. (And some researchers just want to see the world burn; what was Vittersø smoking when he wrote his definition of hedonia?)This is a severe impediment to happiness research, especially if researchers are unaware that others are using different definitions. Quote:The most striking example involves the correlation between measures of eudaimonia and hedonia, as shown in Table\\xa01. When focusing on the trait level—i.e., a person’s typical or average degrees of eudaimonia and hedonia—the correlation has ranged from as low as .0 to as high as .6. When focusing on the state level—i.e., a particular point in time, a given span of time, or a particular type of activity—the correlation between eudaimonia and hedonia has ranged even more widely, from −.3 to .8.Those are huge differences in correlation, even for social science! There are clearly big differences in our results depending on the definitions we use.Looking at the table, we can see that the strongest links between eudaimonia and hedonia are when they are defined as experiences: “feeling engaged (measured as a common factor)” and “feeling pleasure (measured as a common factor)” are correlated at .6; “eudaimonic well-being\" and life satisfaction at .5. It seems that one contributes to the other - or perhaps eudaimonic and hedonic experience partially overlap, with people placing them into the same bucket of “good feelings”.The weakest correlations, meanwhile, are at the behavior level of definition. Eudaimonic behavior and hedonic behavior only correlate at .1. This passes the sniff test, too - the common image of a hedonist is not necessarily that of someone who behaves virtuously or puts effort into self-realization.Orientation is in-between. Eudaimonic constitutive goals & hedonic instrumental goals correlate at .4; same for eudaimonic & hedonic motives. However, eudaimonic and hedonic orientations to happiness only correlate at .2, and there’s no connection at all between “intrinsic aspirations” and hedonic aspirations.Clearly, we need to get all the researchers on the same page. Huta & Waterman have taken a great first step in this regard by making the distinctions clear and classifying all of the core components of hedonia and eudaimonia. Given the 358 citations on this paper, it seems as if most of the field has accepted these norms.Solution #2b: Get everyone to use the same definitionsProblem #3: Response StyleYou got a 5/10 on your Happiness exam, try harder next time.Have you ever tried comparing school grades with someone from a different country? It’s not simple. Tell your American friend that you got a 17/20, they’ll just look at you confused and wonder what you’re so excited about. Meanwhile, when a Belgian student hears of someone who got straight A’s, their jaw will drop - that’s almost unheard of here. It’s not that the Belgian school system is harder, or that American kids are smarter; they’re just using different scales.Two economists, Jorge Alvarez and Fernanda Marquez-Padilla, wondered if people in countries with different grading systems have different response styles. For example, if you’re in the Philippines where 75% is the passing grade, you might report your life satisfaction at 8/10 despite feeling meh about your life - after all, that’s barely above passing, right? A Finnish person on the other hand might rate their life a 5/10 even if they’re quite happy, because for them, a 1/5 is still a pass.[3]\\xa0Alvarez & Marquez-Padilla (2018) is the study where they test this. The results are pretty much exactly what the hypothesis predicted - pass-fail threshold (PFT) was significantly correlated with questions that required a numerical assessment, but not at all with categorical questions (e.g. “have you ever felt on top of the world”, “have you ever felt depressed or very unhappy”). When they try doing a regression to correct for this bias, the “imputed happiness” (i.e. happiness after correction) is more strongly correlated with log income than is reported happiness.This suggests a relatively straightforward solution: correct for grading bias with a simple regression. And indeed, that would solve this specific instance of response style bias. But there’s more!Krueger, Kahneman, Fischler et al. (2009) says that French people use the far ends of the scale less frequently than Americans do, thus biasing the results so it looks like Americans are happier. And according to Meisenberg & Williams (2008), the less intelligent someone is, the more they exhibit the opposite bias - choosing the 1 and 7 more often on a 1-7 scale, for example.This bias is called extreme response style (ERS) and is found basically everywhere. A 2016 meta-analysis indicates further differences between races (Blacks and Hispanics exhibit more ERS, Whites and Asians less) and gender (females exhibit slightly more ERS than men), as well as a positive correlation with acquiescence, which is the tendency to say ‘yes’ to questions asked in surveys. (Acquiescent response set (ARS) is a confounder in its own right, and should be controlled for.)[4]\\xa0There’s a whole array of other response styles/sets out there:People respond in socially desirable ways; if they believe that happiness is normatively appropriate, they may report that they are happier than other types of assessments may indicate. Social desirability of happiness may also vary from country to country.Evasiveness; maybe people of a certain social category or with a certain mindset are more likely to answer “Not Sure”, thus removing them from the data and giving a skewed picture.Speed vs. accuracy; some people will take their time and think deeply about their answers, while others will fill in the first thing that comes to mind.If you want to control for all of these and more, that’s a lot of effort. You can never be sure if there are more confounders out there, either, which is why some scientists don’t believe controlling for confounders can ever prove causality; there’s always one you’ve missed.Luckily, we have another measure to help mitigate the damage: item direction balance. Instead of having all the “good” answers on one side of the scale and all the “bad” answers on the other, switch it up once in a while! This is most effective against acquiescence, because someone tempted to answer ‘yes’ or answer on the high side of the scale won’t bias your results any more.Solution #3: Controls and Direction BalanceConclusionThere you have it: three problems and three solutions! To summarize:Imperfect memory effects can be solved by using experience sampling or day reconstruction.Asymmetry and unclear definitions can be solved by getting all the researchers on the same page and making them use the same definitions.Response style differences can be solved by directional balancing of questions and ungodly amounts of controls.This is a very long post, even after I cut out the aspiration treadmill part (Kahneman’s thoughts about the aspiration treadmill, for those interested). And I haven’t even touched on any of the deeper critiques of the field yet! There’s philosophical critiques, like Angner (2013) and sociological ones like Frawley (2015). All worth reading, all beyond the scope of this post!Happiness research is something certainly worth continuing, for the sake of everyone who would like to enjoy their life. Considering that happiness studies only really started in the 1980s with positive psychology, and that economics and sociology joined in the 2000s and 2010s respectively, there’s certainly a lot left to be discovered in this latest subject to move from the domain of philosophy to that of science.Let’s put in the effort.SourcesThe ones I actually usedBatchelor, J., & Miao, C.

They mention using pagers to alert their subjects. Not really sure why this method only took off in the 2010s, then; maybe the smartphones were just that much more convenient?^It has been debated whether or not the peak-end rule can be generalized from simple experiments to real-world situations; Strijbosch et al. (2019) finds that average valence & arousal is a better predictor than peak-end in the case of more realistic, heterogeneous experiences. They also find that averages, compared to peak-end measures, are better predictors the more time has passed.^The Finnish grading system is actually analogous to the US letter grading system, but instead of A/B/C/D/F, the grades are 5/4/3/2/1. So a 1 will be between <40% and <60%, depending on the curve.^Age is an interesting one: researchers all agree it does something to ERS, but really seem to disagree on what it does. The meta-analysis I just mentioned says that ERS drops sharply with age, consistent with either a linear effect or a curvilinear effect where ERS rises until one’s early 20s, then drops. Schneider (2016), which also analyses the existing literature and adds its own study, says the likelihood of ERS increases significantly with age. I have no clue what to think about this, except that the decrease-over-age conclusion seems intuitively more correct - aren’t people supposed to moderate with time?',\n",

       " {'text': '5.1 Post summary / Table of contentsPart of the “Intro to brain-like-AGI safety” post series.In the previous post, I discussed the “short-term predictor”—a circuit which, thanks to a learning algorithm, emits an output that predicts a ground-truth supervisory signal arriving a short time (e.g. a fraction of a second) later.In this post, I propose that we can take a short-term predictor, wrap it up into a closed loop involving a bit more circuitry, and we wind up with a new module that I call a “long-term predictor”. Just like it sounds, this circuit can make longer-term predictions, e.g. “I’m likely to eat in the next 10 minutes”. This circuit is closely related to Temporal Difference (TD) learning, as we’ll see.I will argue that there are a large collection of side-by-side long-term predictors in the brain, each comprising a short-term predictor in the telencephalon (involving specific areas such as ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala) that loops down to the Steering Subsystem (hypothalamus and brainstem) and then back via a dopamine neuron. These long-term predictors make predictions about biologically-relevant inputs and outputs—for example, one long-term predictor might predict whether I’ll feel pain in my arm, another whether I’ll get goosebumps, another whether I’ll release cortisol, another whether I’ll eat, and so on. Moreover, one of these long-term predictors is essentially a value function for reinforcement learning.All these predictors will play a major role in motivation—a story which I will finish in the next post.Table of contents:Section 5.2 starts with a toy model of a “long-term predictor” circuit, consisting of the “short-term predictor” of the previous post, plus some extra components, wrapped into a closed loop. Getting a good intuitive understanding of this model will be important going forward, and I will walk through how that model would behave under different circumstances.Section 5.3 relates that model to Temporal Difference (TD) learning, which is closely related to a “long-term predictor”. I’ll show two variants of the long-term predictor circuit, a “summation” version (which leads to a value function that approximates the sum of future rewards), and a “switch” version (which leads to a value function that approximates the next reward, whenever it should arrive, which may not be for a long time). The “summation” version is universal in AI literature, but I’ll suggest that the “switch” version is probably closer to what happens in the brain. Incidentally, these two models are equivalent in cases like AlphaGo, wherein reward arrives in a lump sum right at the end of each episode (= game of Go).Section 5.4 will relate long-term predictors to the neuroanatomy of (part of) the telencephalon and brainstem.For the “vertical” neuroanatomy,[1]\\xa0I’ll describe how the brain houses a huge number of parallel “cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops”, and I’ll suggest that some of these loops function as short-term predictors, with a dopamine signal as supervisor.For the “horizontal” neuroanatomy, I’ll propose that the supervised learning I’m talking about involves (for example) the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, anterior insular cortex, and amygdala.Section 5.5 will offer six lines of evidence that lead me to believe this story: (1) It’s a sensible way to implement a biologically-useful capability; (2) It’s introspectively plausible; (3) It’s evolutionarily plausible; (4) It offers a reconciliation between the “visceromotor” and “motivational” ways to describe the medial prefrontal cortex; (5) It explains the Dead Sea Salt experiment; and (6) It offers a nice explanation of the diversity of dopamine neuron activity.5.2 Toy model of a “long-term predictor” circuitA “long-term predictor” is ultimately nothing more than a short-term predictor whose output signal helps determine its own supervisory signal. Here’s a toy model of what that can look like:Toy model of a long-term prediction circuit. I’ll spend the next couple subsections walking through how this works.The blue box is the short-term predictor of the previous post. It optimizes its output signal such that it approximates what the supervisor signal will be in 0.3 seconds (as an example).The purple box is a 2-way switch. The toggle on the switch is controlled by genetically-hardwired circuitry (gray oval), according to the following rules:By and large, the switch is in the bottom setting (“defer-to-predictor mode”). This setting is akin to the genetically-hardwired circuitry “trusting” that the short-term predictor’s output is sensible, and in particular producing the suggested amount of digestive enzymes.If the genetically-hardwired circuitry gets a signal that I’m eating something right now, and that I don’t have adequate digestive enzymes, it flips the switch to “override mode”. Regardless of what the short-term predictor says, it sends the signal to manufacture digestive enzymes.If the genetically-hardwired circuitry has been asking for digestive enzyme production for an extended period, and there’s still no food being eaten, then it again flips the switch to “override mode”. Regardless of what the short-term predictor says, it sends the signal to stop manufacturing digestive enzymes.Note: You can assume that all the signals in the diagram can vary continuously across a range of values (as opposed to being discrete on/off signals), with the exception of the signal that toggles the 2-way switch.[2]\\xa0In the brain, smoothly-adjustable signals might be created by, for example, rate-coding—i.e., encoding information as the frequency with which a neuron is firing.5.2.1 Toy model walkthrough part 1: static contextLet’s walk through what would happen in this toy model.[3]\\xa0To start with, assume that the “context” is static for some extended period of time. For example, imagine a situation where some ancient worm-like creature is digging in the sandy ocean bed for many consecutive minutes. Plausibly, its sensory environment would stay pretty much constant as long as it keeps digging, as would its thoughts and plans (insofar as this ancient worm-like creature has “thoughts and plans” in the first place). Or if you want another example of (approximately) static context—this one involving a human rather than a worm—hang on until the next subsection.In the static-context case, let’s first consider what happens when the switch is sitting in “defer-to-predictor mode”: Since the output is looping right back to the supervisor, there is no error in the supervised learning module. The predictions are correct. The synapses aren’t changing. Even if this situation is very common, it has no bearing on how the short-term predictor eventually winds up behaving.The times that do matter for the eventual behavior of the short-term predictor are those rare times that we go into “override mode”. Think of the overrides as like a sporadic “injection of ground truth”. They produce an error signal in the short-term predictor’s learning algorithm, changing its adjustable parameters (e.g. synapse strengths).After enough life experience (a.k.a. “training” in ML terminology), the short-term predictor should have the property that the overrides balance out. There may still be occasional overrides that increase digestive-enzyme production, and there may still be occasional overrides that decrease digestive-enzyme production, but those two types of overrides should happen with similar frequency. After all, if they didn’t balance out, the short-term predictor’s internal learning algorithm would gradually change its parameters so that they did balance out.And that’s just what we want! We’ll wind up with appropriate digestive enzyme production at appropriate times, in a way that properly accounts for any information available in the context data—what the animal is doing right now, what it’s planning to do in the future, what its current sensory inputs are, etc.5.2.1.1 David-Burns-style exposure therapy—a possible real-life example of the toy model with static context?As it happens, I recently read David Burns’s book Feeling Great (my review). David Burns has a very interesting approach to exposure therapy—an approach that happens to serve as an excellent example of how my toy model works in the static-context situation!Here’s the short version. (Warning: If you’re thinking of doing exposure therapy on yourself at home, at least read the whole book first!) Excerpt from the book:For example, when I was in high school, I wanted to be on the stage crew of Brigadoon, a play my school was putting on, but it required overcoming my fear of heights since the stage crew had to climb ladders and work near the ceiling to adjust the lights and curtains. My drama teacher, Mr. Krishak, helped me overcome this fear with the very type of exposure techniques I’m talking about. He led me to the theater and put a tall ladder in the middle of the stage, where there was nothing nearby to grab or hold on to. He told me all I had to do was stand on the top of the ladder until my fear disappeared. He reassured me that he’d stand on the floor next to me and wait.I began climbing the ladder, step by step, and became more and more frightened. When I got to the top, I was terrified. My eyes were almost 18 feet from the floor, since the ladder was 12 feet tall, and I was just over 6 feet tall. I told Mr. Krishak I was in a panic and asked what I should do. Was there something I should say, do, or think about to make my anxiety go away? He shook his head and told me to just stand there until I was cured.I continued to stand there in terror for about ten more minutes. When I told Mr. Krishak I was still in a panic, he assured me that I was doing great and that I should just stand there a few more minutes until my anxiety went away. A few minutes later, my anxiety suddenly disappeared. I couldn’t believe it!I told him, “Hey, Mr. Krishak, I’m cured now!”He said, “Great, you can come on down from the ladder now, and you can be on the stage crew of Brigadoon!”I had a blast working on the stage crew. I absolutely loved climbing ladders and adjusting the lights and curtains near the ceiling, and I couldn’t even remember why or how I’d been so afraid of heights.This story seems to be beautifully consistent with my toy model here. David started the day in a state where his short-term-predictors output “extremely strong fear reactions” when he was up high. As long as David stayed up on the ladder, those fear-reaction short-term-predictors kept on getting the same context data, and therefore they kept on firing their outputs at full strength. And David just kept feeling terrified.Then, after 15 boring-yet-terrifying minutes on the ladder, some innate circuit in David’s brainstem issued an override—as if to say, “C’mon, nothing is changing, nothing is happening, we can’t just keep burning all these calories all day. It’s time to calm down now.” The short-term-predictors continued sending the same outputs as before, but the brainstem exercised its veto power, and forcibly reset David’s cortisol, heart-rate, etc., back to baseline. This “override” state immediately created error signals in the relevant short-term-predictors in David’s amygdala! And the error signals, in turn, led to model updates! The short-term predictors were all edited, and from then on, David was no longer afraid of heights.This story kinda feels like speculation piled on top of speculation, but whatever, I happen to think it’s right. If nothing else, it’s good pedagogy! Here’s the diagram for this situation; make sure you can follow all the steps.5.2.2 Toy model walkthrough, assuming changing contextThe previous subsections assumed static context lines (constant sensory environment, constant behaviors, constant thoughts and plans, etc.). What happens if the context is not static?If the context lines are changing, then it’s no longer true that learning happens only at “overrides”. If context changes in the absence of “overrides”, it will result in changing of the output, and the new output will be treated as ground truth for what the old output should have been. Again, this seems to be just what we want: if we learned something new and relevant in the last second, then our current expectation should be more accurate than our previous expectation, and thus we have a sound basis for updating our models.5.3 Value function calculation (TD learning) as a special case of long-term predictionAt this point, ML experts will recognize a resemblance to Temporal Difference (TD) learning. It’s not quite the same, though. The differences are:First, TD learning is usually used in reinforcement learning (RL) as a method for going from a reward function to a value function. By contrast, I was talking about things like “digestive enzyme production”, which are neither rewards nor values.In other words, there is a generally-useful motif that involves going from some immediate quantity X to “long term expectation of X”. The calculation of a value function from a reward function is an example of that motif, but it’s not the only useful example.(As a matter of terminology, it seems to be generally accepted that the term “TD learning” can in fact apply to things that are not RL value functions.[4]\\xa0However, empirically in my own experience, as soon as I mention “TD learning”, the people I’m talking to immediately assume I must be talking about RL value functions. So I want to be clear here.)Second, to get something closer to traditional TD learning, we’d need to replace the 2-way switch with a 2-way summation—and then the “overrides” would be analogous to rewards. Much more on “switch vs summation” in the next subsection.\\xa0Here’s a TD learning circuit that would behave similarly to what you’d see in an AI textbook. Note the purple box on the right: compared to the previous figure, I replaced the 2-way switch with a 2-way summation. More on “switch vs summation” in the next subsection.Third, there are many additional ways to tweak the circuit which are frequently used in AI textbooks, and some of those may be involved in the brain circuits too. For example, we can put in time-discounting, or different emphases on false-positives vs false-negatives (see my discussion of distributional reinforcement learning here), etc.To keep things simple, I will be ignoring all these possibilities (including time-discounting) in the discussion below.5.3.1 Switch (i.e., value = expected next reward) vs summation (i.e., value = expected sum of future rewards)?The figures above show two variants of our toy model. In one, the purple box is a two-way switch between “defer to the short-term predictor” and some independent “ground truth”. In the other, the purple box is a two-way summation instead.The switch version trains the short-term-predictor to predict the next ground truth, whenever it should arrive.The summation version trains the short-term-predictor to predict the sum of future ground truth signals.The correct answer could also be “something in between switch and summation”. Or it could even be “none of the above”.RL papers universally use the summation version—i.e., “value is the expected sum of future rewards”. What about biology? And which is actually better?It doesn’t always matter! Consider AlphaGo. Like every RL paper today, AlphaGo was originally formulated in the summation paradigm. But it happens to have one and only one nonzero reward signal per game, namely +1 at the end of the game if it wins, or -1 if it loses. In that case, switch vs summation makes no difference. The only difference is one of terminology:In the summation case, we would say “each non-terminal move in the Go game has reward=0”.In the switch case, we would say “each non-terminal move in the Go game has a reward of (null)”.(Do you see why?)But in other cases, it does matter. So back to the question: should it be switch or summation?Let’s step back. What are we trying to do here?One thing that a brain needs to do is make decisions that weigh cross-domain tradeoffs. If you’re a human, you need to decide whether to watch TV or go to the gym. If you’re some ancient worm-like creature, you need to “decide” whether to dig or to swim. Either way, this “decision” impacts energy balance, salt balance, probability of injury, probability of mating—you name it. The design goal in the decision-making algorithm is that you make the decision that maximizes inclusive genetic fitness. How might that goal be best realized?One method involves building a value function that estimates the organism’s inclusive genetic fitness (compared to some arbitrary—indeed, possibly time-varying—baseline), conditional on continuing to execute a given course of action. Of course it won’t be a perfect estimate—real inclusive genetic fitness can only be calculated in hindsight, many generations after the fact. But once we have such a value function, however imperfect, we can plug it into an algorithm that makes decisions to maximize value (more on this in the next post), and thus we get approximately-fitness-maximizing behavior.So having a value function is key for making good decisions that weigh cross-domain tradeoffs. But nowhere in this story is the claim “value is the expectation of a sum of future rewards”! That’s a particular way of setting up the value-approximating algorithm, a method which might or might not be well suited to the situation at hand.I happen to think that brains use something closer to the switch circuit, not the summation circuit, not only for homeostatic-type predictions (like the digestive enzymes example above), but also for value functions, contrary to mainstream RL papers. Again, I think it’s really “neither of the above” in all cases; just that it’s closer to switch.Why do I favor “switch” over “summation”?An example: sometimes I stub my toe and it hurts for 20 seconds; other times I stub my toe and it hurts for 40 seconds. But I don’t think of the latter as twice as bad as the former. In fact, even five minutes later, I wouldn’t remember which is which. (See the peak-end rule.) This is the kind of thing I would naturally expect from switch, but is an awkward fit for summation. It’s not strictly incompatible with summation; it just requires a more complicated, value-dependent reward function. As a matter of fact, if we allow the reward function to depend on value, then switch and summation can imitate each other.Anyway, in upcoming posts, I’ll be assuming switch, not summation. I don’t think it matters very much for the big picture. I definitely don’t think it’s part of the “secret sauce” of animal intelligence, or anything like that. But it does affect some of the detailed descriptions.The next post will include more details of reinforcement learning in the brain, including how “reward prediction error” works and so on. I am bracing for lots of confused readers, who will be disoriented by the fact that I’m assuming a different relationship between value and reward than what everyone is used to. For example, in my picture, “reward” is a synonym for “ground truth for what the value function should be right now”—both should account for not only the organism’s current circumstances but also its future prospects. Sorry in advance for any confusion! I will do my best to be clear.5.4 An array of long-term predictors involving the telencephalon & brainstemHere’s the long-term-predictor circuit from above:Copied from above.I can lump together the 2-way switch with the rest of the genetically-hardwired circuitry, and then rearrange the boxes a bit, and I get the following:Same as above, but drawn differently.Now, obviously digestive enzymes are just one example. Let’s draw in some more examples, add some hypothesized neuroanatomy, and include other terminology. Here’s the result:I claim that there is a bank of long-term-predictors, consisting of an array of short-term-predictors in the telencephalon, each with a closed-loop connection to a corresponding Steering Subsystem circuit. I’m calling the former (telencephalon) part by the name “Thought Assessors”, for reasons explained in Section 5.5.4 below. Acronym: mPFC = medial prefrontal cortexExcellent! We’re halfway to my big picture of decision-making and motivation. The rest of the picture—including the “actor” part of actor-critic reinforcement learning—will come in the next post, and will fill in the hole in the top-left side of that diagram.Here’s one more diagram and caption for pedagogical purposes. (The term “Steering Subsystem” comes from Post #3.)Reminder: a “short-term predictor” is one component of a “long-term predictor”. Here’s where both those things fit into that diagram above. The only thing that makes it a long-term predictor is the possibility of “defer-to-predictor mode”—i.e., the Steering Subsystem might send a “ground truth in hindsight” signal that is not really “ground truth” in the normal sense, but is rather a copy of the corresponding entry on the scorecard. In other words, “defer-to-predictor mode” is like the Steering Subsystem saying to the short-term predictor: “OK sure, whatever, I’ll take your word for it”. If the Steering Subsystem regularly keeps a signal in “defer-to-predictor mode” for 10 minutes straight, then we can get predictions that anticipate the future by up to 10 minutes. Conversely, if the Steering Subsystem never uses “defer-to-predictor mode” for a certain signal, then we shouldn’t really be calling it a “long-term predictor” in the first place.In the next two subsections, I will elaborate on the neuroanatomy which I’m hinting at in this diagram, and then I’ll talk about why you should believe me.5.4.1 “Vertical” neuroanatomy:[1]\\xa0cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loopsIn my post Big Picture of Phasic Dopamine, I talked about the theory (due originally to Larry Swanson) that the whole telencephalon is nicely organized into three layers (cortex, striatum, pallidum):Cortex-like part of the loops\\xa0Hippo-campusAmygdala [basolateral part]Piriform cortexMedial prefrontal cortexMotor & “planning” cortexStriatum-like part of the loops\\xa0Lateral septumAmygdala [central part]Olfactory tubercleVentral striatumDorsal striatumPallidum-like part of the loops\\xa0Medial septumBNSTSubstantia innominataVentral pallidumGlobus pallidusThe entire telencephalon—neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, everything—can be divided into cortex-like structures, striatum-like structures, and pallidum-like structures. If two structures are in the same column in this table, that means they’re wired together into cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops (see next paragraph). This table is incomplete and oversimplified; for a better version see Fig. 4 here.This idea then connects to the earlier (and now widely accepted) theory, dating to Alexander 1986, that these three layers of the telencephalon are interconnected into a large number of parallel “cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops”, which can be found in almost every part of the telencephalon.Here’s a little illustration:Simplified cartoon illustration of how the brain has many parallel cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. Source: Matthieu Thiboust.Given all that, here is a possible rough model for how this loop architecture relates to the short-term predictor learning algorithm that I’ve been talking about:See Big Picture of Phasic Dopamine for slightly more details, but mostly I haven’t looked into it much, and in particular the “Layer 1, Layer 2, Final (pooling) layer” labels are kinda just spitballing. (The “pooling” is based on there being 2000× more neurons in the striatum than the pallidum—see here.) Acronyms: BLA=basolateral amygdala, BNST=bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, CEA=central amygdala, mPFC=medial prefrontal cortex, VP=ventral pallidum, VS=ventral striatum.5.4.2 “Horizontal” neuroanatomy—cortical specializationThe previous subsection was about the “vertical” three-layer structure of the telencephalon. Now let’s switch to the “horizontal” structure, i.e. the fact that different parts of the cortex do different things (in cooperation with the corresponding parts of the striatum and pallidum).This is oversimplified, but here’s my latest attempt at (part of) the cortex in a nutshell:The extended motor cortex is the cortex’s main output region for behaviors involving skeletal muscles, like reaching and walking.The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC—which also includes anterior cingulate cortex) is the cortex’s main output region for behaviors involving autonomic / visceromotor / hormonal actions, like releasing cortisol, vasoconstriction, goosebumps, and so on.The amygdala is the cortex’s main output region for certain behaviors that involve both skeletal muscle actions and autonomic actions, like flinching-reactions, or freezing-reactions (when frightened), and so on.The insular cortex is the cortex’s main input region for autonomic / homeostatic / body status information, like blood sugar levels, pain, cold, taste, muscle strain, etc.I won’t talk about the motor cortex in this series, but I think the other three are all involved in these long-term prediction circuits. For example:I claim that if you look at a little subregion in the medial prefrontal cortex, you might find that it’s being trained to fire in proportion to the probability of upcoming cortisol release;I claim that if you look at a little subregion in the amygdala, you might find that it’s being trained to fire in proportion to the probability of upcoming freezing-reactions;I claim that if you look at a little subregion of the (anterior) insular cortex, you might find that it’s being trained to fire in proportion to the probability of upcoming cold feelings in your left arm.5.5 Six reasons I like this “array of long-term predictors” picture5.5.1 It’s a sensible way to implement a biologically-useful capabilityIf you start producing digestive enzymes before eating, you’ll digest faster. If your heart starts racing before you see the lion, then your muscles will be primed and ready to go when you do see the lion. Etc.So these kinds of predictors seem obviously useful.Moreover, as discussed in the previous post (Section 4.5.2), the technique I’m proposing here (based on supervised learning) seems either superior to or complementary with other ways to meet these needs.5.5.2 It’s introspectively plausibleFor one thing, we do in fact start salivating before we eat the cracker, start feeling nervous before we see the lion, etc.For another thing, consider the fact that all the actions I’m talking about in this post are involuntary: you cannot salivate on command, or dilate your pupils on command, etc., at least not in quite the same way that you can wiggle your thumb on command.(More on voluntary actions in the next post—they’re in a whole different part of the telencephalon.)I’m glossing over a bunch of complications here, but the involuntary nature of these things seems pleasingly consistent with the idea that they are being trained by their own dedicated supervisory signals, straight from the brainstem. They’re slaves to a different master, so to speak. We can kinda trick them into behaving in certain ways, but our control is limited and indirect.5.5.3 It’s evolutionary plausibleAs discussed in Section 4.4 of the previous post, the simplest short-term predictor is extraordinarily simple, and the simplest long-term predictor is only a bit more complicated than that. And these very simple versions are already plausibly fitness-enhancing, even in very simple animals.Moreover, as I discussed a while back (Dopamine-supervised learning in mammals & fruit flies), there is an array of little learning modules in the fruit fly, playing a seemingly-similar role to what I’m talking about here. Those modules also use dopamine as a supervisory signal, and there is some genomic evidence of a homology between those circuits and the mammalian telencephalon.5.5.4 It offers a reconciliation between “visceromotor” and “motivation” pictures of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)Take the mPFC (which also includes the anterior cingulate cortex—ACC), as an example. People talk about this region in two quite different ways:On the one hand, as mentioned above (Section 5.4.2), mPFC is described as a visceromotor / homeostatic / autonomic motor output region—it issues commands to control hormones, to execute sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system reactions, and so on. For example, “electrical stimulation of the infralimbic cortex has been shown to affect gastric motility and to cause hypotension”, or this paper says stimulating mPFC caused “[bristling]; pupillary dilation; and changes in blood pressure, respiratory rate, and heart rate”, or see Bud Craig’s book which characterizes ACC as a homeostatic motor output center. This way of thinking also elegantly explains the fact that the region is agranular (missing layer #4 out of the 6 neocortex layers), which implies “output region” both for theoretical reasons and by analogy with the (agranular) motor cortex.On the other hand, mPFC is frequently described as being related to a host of vaguely-motivation-related activities. For example, Wikipedia mentions “attention allocation, reward anticipation, decision-making, ethics and morality, impulse control … and emotion” in regards to ACC.I think my picture works for both:[5]For the first (visceromotor) perspective, if you look at Section 5.2 above, you’ll see that the predictors’ outputs do in fact cause homeostatic changes—at least, they do when the genetically-hardwired circuitry of the Steering Subsystem has set that signal in “defer-to-predictor mode” (as opposed to “override mode”).For the second (motivation) perspective, this will make a bit more sense after the next post, but note my suggestive description of a “scorecard” in the diagram of Section 5.4. The idea is: The “context” lines going into the “Thought Assessors” contain the horrific complexity of everything in your conscious mind and more—where you are, what you’re seeing and doing, what you’re thinking about, what you’re planning to do in the future and why, etc. The relatively simple, genetically-hardcoded Steering Subsystem can’t make heads or tails of any of that!But that’s a dilemma, because the Steering Subsystem is the source of rewards / drives / motivations! How can the Steering Subsystem issue rewards for a good plan, if it can’t make heads or tails of what you’re planning??The “scorecard” is the answer. It takes all that horrific complexity and distills it into a nice standardized scorecard—exactly the kind of thing that genetically-hardcoded circuits in the Steering Subsystem can easily process.Thus, whenever there’s an interaction between thoughts and drives—emotions, decision-making, ethics, aversions, etc.—the “Thought Assessors” need to be involved as an intermediary.5.5.5 It explains the dead-sea salt experimentSee my discussion in my old post Inner alignment in salt-starved rats. In brief, experimenters sporadically played a sound and popped an object into a rat’s cage, and immediately thereafter sprayed super-salty water directly into the rat’s mouth. The rat found the saltwater disgusting, and started reacting with horror to the sound and object. Then later, the experimenters made the rat feel salt-deprived. When they played the sound and popped the object this time, the rat got very excited—even though the rat had never been salt-deprived before in its life.In our setup, this is exactly what we expect: when the sound and object appear, the “I anticipate tasting salt” predictor starts firing like crazy. Meanwhile the Steering Subsystem (hypothalamus & brainstem) has hardwired circuitry that says “If I’m salt-deprived, and if the ‘scorecard’ from the Learning Subsystem suggests that I will soon taste salt, then that’s awesome, and whatever thought the Learning Subsystem is thinking, it should pursue that idea with gusto!”5.5.6 It offers a nice explanation for the diversity of dopamine neuron activityRecall from Section 5.4.1 above that I’m claiming that dopamine neurons carry the supervisory signals of all these supervised-learning modules.[6]There’s a pop-science misconception that there is a (singular) dopamine signal in the brain, and it bursts when good things are happening. In reality, there are many different dopamine neurons doing many different things.Thus we get the question: what are all these diverse dopamine signals doing? There’s no consensus; claims in the literature are all over the place. But I can throw my hat into the ring: in my picture described above, there are probably hundreds or thousands of short-term predictors in the telencephalon, predicting hundreds or thousands of different things, and they each need a different dopamine supervisory signal!(And there are even more dopamine signals besides those! One such signal, associated with the brain’s “main” reward prediction error signal, will show up in the next post. Still others are off-topic for this series but discussed here.)If my story is right, what would we expect to see in dopamine-measuring experiments?Imagine a rat running through a maze. Moment by moment, its array of predictors are getting dopamine supervisory signals about its various hormone levels, its heart rate, its expectation of drinking and eating and having a sore leg and freezing and tasting salt, and on and on. In short, we expect dopamine neurons to be bouncing up and down in all kinds of different ways.Thus, pretty much any instance where an experimenter has measured that a dopamine neuron is correlated with some behavioral variable, it’s probably consistent with my picture too.Here are a couple examples:There are dopamine neurons that burst for salient stimuli like unexpected flashes of light (ref). Can I explain that? Sure, no problem! I say: they could be supervisory signals saying “this would have been a good time to orient”, or “to flinch”, or “to raise your heart rate”, etc.There are dopamine neurons that correlate with the velocity with which a mouse is running on a treadmill-ball (ref). Can I explain that? Sure, no problem! I say: they could be supervisory signals saying “expect sore muscles”, or “expect cortisol”, or “expect high heart rate”, etc.Here’s another data point which seems reassuringly consistent with my picture. A few dopamine neurons burst when aversive things happen (ref). Four of the five regions[7]\\xa0in which such neurons can be found (according to the linked paper) are right where I expect that array of short-term predictors to be—namely, the cortex-like and striatum-like layers of amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the ventromedial shell of the nucleus accumbens, which is (at least roughly?) the striatum stop of the mPFC cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. This is exactly what I expect in my picture. For example, if a mouse gets shocked, then a “should-I-freeze-now” predictor would get a supervisory signal saying “Yes, you should have been freezing”.5.5.6.1 Aside: Distributional predictor outputsI didn’t talk about it in the last post, but short-term predictors have hyperparameters in their learning algorithms, two of which are “how strongly to update upon a false-positive (overshoot) error”, and “how strongly to update upon a false-negative (undershoot) error”. As the ratio of these two hyperparameters varies from 0 to ∞, the resulting predictor behavior varies from “fire the output if there’s even the faintest chance that the supervisor will fire” to “never fire the output unless it’s all but certain that the supervisor will fire”.Therefore, if we have many predictors, each with a different ratio of those hyperparameters, then we can (at least approximately) output a probability distribution for the prediction, rather than a point estimate.A recent set of experiments from DeepMind and collaborators found evidence (based on measurements of dopamine neurons) that the brain does in fact use this trick, at least for reward prediction.I speculate that it may use the same trick for the other long-term predictors too—e.g. maybe the predictions of arm pain and cortisol and goosebumps etc. are all in the form of ensembles of long-term predictors that each sample a probability distribution.I bring this up, first, because it’s another example where dopamine neurons are behaving in a way that seems pleasingly consistent with my worldview, and second, because it’s plausibly useful for AGI safety—and thus I was looking for an excuse to bring it up anyway!5.5.7 SummaryAnyway, as usual I don’t pretend to have smoking-gun proof of my hypothesis (i.e. that the brain has an array of long-term predictors involving telencephalon-brainstem loops). But considering the evidence in this and previous subsections, I wind up feeling strongly that I’m broadly on the right track. I’m happy to discuss more in the comments. Otherwise, onward to the next post, where we will finally put everything together into a big picture of how I think motivation and decision-making work in the brain!^‘Horizontal’ neuroanatomy versus ‘vertical’ neuroanatomy is my idiosyncratic terminology, but I’m hoping it’s intuitive. If you imagine stretching out the cortex into a sheet, oriented horizontally, then the ‘vertical’ neuroanatomy would include e.g. the interconnections between cortical and subcortical structures, and the ‘horizontal’ neuroanatomy would include e.g. the different roles played by different parts of the cortex. See also the table in Section 5.4.1.^To be clear, in reality, there probably isn’t a discrete all-or-nothing 2-way switch here. There could be a “weighted average” setting, for example. Remember, this whole discussion is just a pedagogical “toy model”; I expect that reality is more complicated in various respects.^I note that I’m just running through this algorithm in my head; I haven’t simulated it. I’m optimistic that I didn’t majorly screw up, i.e. that everything I’m saying about the algorithm is qualitatively true, or at least can be qualitatively true with appropriate parameter settings and perhaps other minor tweaks.\\xa0^Examples of using the terminology “TD learning” for something which is not related to RL reward functions include “TD networks”, and the Successor Representations literature (example), or this paper, etc.^The classic attempt to reconcile “visceromotor” and “motivation” pictures of mPFC is Antonio Damasio’s “somatic marker hypothesis”. My discussion here has some similarities and some differences from the somatic marker hypothesis. I won’t get into that; it’s off-topic.^As in the previous post, when I say that “dopamine carries the supervisory signal”, I’m open to the possibility that dopamine is actually a closely-related signal like the error signal, or the negative error signal, or the negative supervisory signal. It really doesn’t matter for present purposes.^The fifth area where that paper found dopamine neurons bursting under aversive circumstances, namely the tail of the striatum, has a different explanation I think—see here.',\n",

       " {'text': \"If there’s one lesson that I learned from almost every single smart person I know, it’s:The unreasonable effectiveness of doing, then thinking; vs thinking too much before doingThis is not something I’ve been able to convince anyone of, at least not with a rational argument. I might tell people things like:Stop ruminating about changing jobs, make accounts at x/y/z today, and fill them in minimally... yes, like, in 20 minutes, yes, it’s fine if they are not perfect. Then apply to 100 jobs, no, no, don’t spend 1 hour ruminating over each one, just write a 5-minute intention letter, you’ll have like a 5% reply rate anyway, just focus on the ones that send interview... I don’t mean like that, don’t ruminate for hours about every interview!OrYeah, it’s a super complex piece of kit you need to build. But like, you’ve given me a use-case, you explained one of its components, just write a test and see where it goes. Yeah, I understand the test will fail, I understand it won’t even compile, whatever, just write it. Or if you don’t want to do that write the component you described to me, it can be broken, doesn’t matter. Or heck, find a similar~ish project and just copy-paste it and start cutting and remaking. Doesn’t matter that you’re starting from a Reddit clone and you want to build genetics testing CRM, it can still serve as a starting-off point.OrYeap, getting into a new field is hard, but whatever, fake it til you make it. Buy the right books, follow the right people on Twitter, read the right blogs, build something that seems like it suits that field. Yes, the books will be wrong, you’ll be following dumb people that every insider actually derides, the blogs will be off-topic, you’ll build something shamefully bad. Doesn’t matter, just do it.And I can’t for the life of me convince people about doing these things because they seem “rash”... and I keep thinking (therefore I know I exist): “what the fuck are they thinking” (therefore I know they exist as a separate entity), “why is this rash, you’re not trying to spear-hunt a fucking bear, you're writing some code in the privacy of your own home, the place you masturbate in, surely the shame of failing miserably can’t be that bad”.Anyway, I’m not going to try to convince anyone to do then think. I can’t prove nor even properly conceptualize why you should start doing that. But I want to try and at least think about a few reasons why doing before thinking, or at least doing something that seems like doing before thinking, is so unreasonably ineffective.Something Something Subconscious ImmersionYou all know the drill here.Brilliant scientist thinks a lot about a problem, gathers all the data that doesn’t make sense and all the data that already makes sense and needs to keep making sense, struggles for a few days and comes up with nothing... then, he wakes up from a dream drooling inspiration, runs to his notebook in a trance and figures out relativity/microscopy/the periodic table/DNA structure.If we assume that, at any given time, a large part of brain networks are inactive or below the state of conscious control, then it’s only a short inference away that the patterns of thought that’d bring them online are best triggered by actually doing the tasks and letting said networks “figure out” that they need to to help and how.Examples of this that everyone’s noticed are learning to ride a bike, row, climb, surf, etc. Complex motor skills are learned with minimal conscious input, the conscious mind just decided to get on the bike as best it can, it receives instructions like “push with your leg in a sort of rotation motion”... and 1 hour later the network that can actually handle bike riding has learned how to do it. It’s important to note that riding a bike can’t be first learned at a theoretical level.Rational Thought Is Best Past a Certain Data ThresholdAnyway, we’re talking about things that are more complex than bike riding here, so I get that the analogy doesn’t fit perfectly, but remember that bit about theory not being useful for beginners? I assume it’s not the same for professionals.Professional bikers might spend hours a day discussing cycling theory, optimizing things besides bike riding like their doping regiment, training adjacent skills that they think are particularly important but hard to train “while doing the thing”. Professional sportspeople in general presumably do this quite a lot, though I expect it’s much more common at complex sports (think football, skiing) than at simple ones (sprinting, javelin throwing).This might in part work because rational thought is good at polishing up ideas and behaviors but can’t start from a position of insufficient data, or rather, is really dumb from a position of insufficient data.Let's think of a complex skill that people are really anxious about practicing, let’s say picking up people or interviewing with an important manager. How’s intuitively going to be better, someone that read a dozen interviewing-and-business/pickup-artistry books and watched videos and prepared bits to say... or someone that’s already done it 4 or 5 times (even if they failed)? Almost certainly the latter.Theory and rationality seem to only help from a position where data is plentiful to think with, where there are real-world examples to think about, where you’ve already “felt” a system from the inside. Sure enough, people seem to have come up with a promising theory about mechanics much sooner than about waves, and for seemingly no fault of experimental devices, it’s just that we “do mechanics” in our day-to-day lives.Thinking Is Meant For Dangerous ScenariosLet’s say thinking involves several disadvantages, it wastes time, it stresses you out, it makes you less likely to do anything in the long term (because doing anything is stressful and time-consuming), and so on.This would still make thinking advantageous if you have to go spear that bear since you want that kind of scenario to be a once-in-a-lifetime thing, so the extra stress and time is not only worthwhile for a slightly lower chance of death, it’s the appropriate signal to send: “This is really hard and dangerous, don’t do this ever again”.Alas, we are usually in lack of life and death scenarios, and furthermore, we are trained to think too much in easy situations that should require no thought (e.g. solving math problems at school) in order to get a slight edge over someone else (e.g. during an exam).So it might be that doing than thinking is unreasonably effective because we trade-off on wasting time and producing anxiety that might make us never take useful action, to begin with.An important bit there is to remember that the network/self/you which thought the action is good is often not the network doing it. Maybe you did ponder the idea of getting a new job for a lot, decided on yes, and now the pesky you actually doing the job searching is thinking through every single job as though I’d be a life-and-death decision whether or not to apply. This leads me to...We Often Think About Stuff That’s Already DecidedSure, it’s good to question the fundamentals of math every now and then, but maybe it’s not best to do it as part of solving a mildly annoying but certainly-doable calculation. It’s also worth thinking if you’ve gone a bit too extreme with your dieting, but doing so in the middle of a diet is bound to always result in you rationalizing “yes” to be the answer in order to splurge on sweets.Thinking often leads us to quickly rethink at the “meta” level where a decision was already made, potentially a very thoughtful and thorough decision we made a while ago.An important note here is that this should bias us against both thinking too much while doing something that’s been decided upon and towards planning fewer things at the “meta” level, leaving the doing for some other-self.We Can’t Control Thought Through Anything But ActionEven though we have a lot of “mental power” available at any given moment, most of what we do with it feels “unelected”, we lack understanding about why conscious thoughts flow the way they do.But a pretty reliable way to control thought is to put yourself into a situation where thought must take a certain pattern.If you jump through a small hole in the roof of a bear’s den, wooden spear in hand, barely not awaking the fiend from hibernation, you’ll probably have more optimal thoughts about bear-killing than if you tried to “imagine” the scene. But the trade-off is risk. Similarly, with social situations, risks of saying the wrong thing or grooming the wrong monkey could have been rather high. So we grew to love “imagining” and be afraid of action.What we think of when not acting will be a function of what seems “most important”, thus many people end up ruminating about things such as politics, socializing and phobias. What we think of when acting will be the process itself, thus shortcutting the prioritization process.None of this is a conclusive answer to the question, much less so a proof, but these are some of the intuitions I have about it.As an aside, I conceptualize all of these intuitions while writing, maybe there were already formed in my subconscious, maybe they were created as a result of the imagined constraint of having to write this article, maybe they are all bad because I didn’t spend more than 30 minutes consciously ruminating on the subject, or maybe they are as good as the answers of someone that meditated upon the question his entire life... If only I could know for sure.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'This is cross-posted from my blog and is written more for a general audience rather than LessWrong people who will be more familiar with some of the relevant concepts.Robert McIntrye is an all-around smart and interesting dude, and he’s the CEO of Nectome, a startup devoted to preserving the human brain.Last year, I wrote a summary of Robert’s brain preservation talk at the Long Now Foundation:https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/N7j4xHkyjKbimmF6A/notes-on-robert-mcintyre-s-brain-preservation-talk-at-the-1He later read it and reached out to me about discussing our thoughts. I asked if I could record it as an interview and here we are!We dive into topics such as brain preservation, personal identity, life extension, AGI, Rick and Morty, and why he’s worried about the current state of cryonics.Our interview went for over three hours and we weren’t anywhere close to exhausting our conversation (but we did exhaust my bladder capacity).A lot of time was spent on personal identity and the teletransportation paradox.We talked a lot about things we don’t actually disagree on, but I’m glad we did because it will help clear up confusion for listeners who aren’t on the same page.The crux of our actual disagreement is as follows: I wouldn’t destructively copy myself, as in the case of the teletransportation paradox, and he would.If you’ve read the Three Buckets, you know that I care about my own utility and the utility of my loved ones.Imagine someone made a perfect copy of me.If my copy’s hand was pricked, he would feel the pain but I wouldn’t. If that copy was eating a double-double animal style from In-N-Out, he would be enjoying the taste of that goodness but I wouldn’t be.While I’d prefer for my copy to be feeling pleasure rather than pain, if I had to choose, I’d prefer to be the one eating In-N-Out and not getting his hand pricked.It’s not that I don’t care if my copy is enjoying life. It’s that I don’t care as much because I’m not experiencing it. This seems intuitive and obvious to me.Personal identity is a messy concept. We didn’t evolve for our intuitions to handle complicated and messy scenarios such as being perfectly copied. There was no transporter to Mars in the ancestral environment.I don’t want to be destructively uploaded because “I” (which, yes, is a messy term) would not be experiencing anything anymore. Yes, in some sense “I” would still exist because my memories would still be in a different copy. But that copy is the one enjoying Mars, not me. And I care about the John who is experiencing my qualia more than another John.Robert values his memories surviving and the algorithm that is his consciousness running somewhere, so he is fine with his current self being terminated as long as other copies are around with his memories.Do you agree with Robert? Would you be fine with having copies of yourself and then destroying your current copy?Let me know your thoughts, what questions I should ask in the future, and who I should talk to next in the comments below!

To enable the collaborative editor, you must check \"Opt into experimental features\" in your account settings and then press the green \"Share\" button that appears when editing your post.You can experiment with commenting and suggesting on this post with this link.It\\'s been a loooong time coming[1]\\xa0but at last, we are ready to unveil collaborative editing features for the LessWrong text editor. These features will be familiar to those used to working in Google Docs:Multiple users can edit a document at onceFine-grained permissions for viewing/commenting/editing by link or usernameInline comments (only viewable while in edit mode)Making and accepting suggested editsAutomatic savingVersion history viewerSome advantages of using LW-Docs with collaborative editing:LW-Docs supports LaTeX, unlike Google Docs.If you use entirely LW-Docs, you won\\'t have broken footnotes, unlike with copying from G-Docs.While writing your post, you\\'ll know what the end result will look like (same font and line width) which helps you optimize paragraphs and layout for looking good when published.You can continue to get inline feedback and suggestions on your post even after you\\'ve copied it over to LessWrong.These can then be seamlessly integrated into your live post.INLINE COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE ONLY VIEWABLE IN EDIT MODE TO THOSE WITH PERMISSIONSThe sharing dialogHow to enable collaborative editing on your postStep 1: Opt in to experimental features in your account settings.Step 2: While editing your post, click the green \"Share\" button in the top right.

Being in Comment mode means you only suggest changes rather than actually make them.\\xa0\\xa0Step 6: Leave feedback about the feature!This feature is still under development. Any feedback from early-adopters is hugely helpful. Just leave a comment on this post or message us on Intercom.Warning! Rough around the edgesWe\\'re releasing this feature in beta mode because it still requires a few more finishing touches and might be a little confusing to use in places. As above, any feedback is greatly appreciated.Why collaborative editing?When developing features, there\\'s always a question of \"does anyone want this?\" In the case of collaborative editing features, there\\'s good evidence of demand from Google Docs. There\\'s a common workflow that goes: (1) write a draft in Google Docs, (2) invite some close friends or collaborators to give feedback, (3) incorporate feedback, (4) copy to LessWrong, (5) publish.Drawbacks of this workflow are (a) overhead of copying and reformatting the post, (b) enforcing a hard break between the feedback stage and the publication stage, (c) Google Docs does not support LaTeX, (d) valuable comments left in the feedback stage never get published to the wider world.By introducing collaborative editing to LessWrong, we address (a), (b), and (c). We haven\\'t yet made it so in-line comments in editing mode can be published in the final version, but we\\'ll look into ways to allow for that. I also expect that we\\'ll add additional features[2]\\xa0to our editor that Google Docs doesn\\'t have, such that users will benefit from the possibility of doing all their writing on LessWrong.Having collaborative editing features on LessWrong also lets us start to build programs that rely on easy ways to give people feedback on their drafts. For example, I\\'d like to run a writing and research workshop for students that involves peer and mentor feedback. With collaborative editing on LessWrong, that will now be much more convenient to do.What\\'s your writing workflow?If you\\'re an author, I\\'d love to hear how collaborative editing features do or don\\'t help you with your workflow, or what you\\'d really like to see us build. Feel free to comment on this post or message us on Intercom.Thanks and good luck!\\xa0^It\\'s been ~18 months since the first steps towards this were taken.^One feature I\\'m particularly excited about is \"link-searching\".

       " {'text': 'I got married today, to the particular fellow mentioned in my Turning 30 post. In a sort of \\'inverse cat tax\\'[1]\\xa0for a sappy announcement, here\\'s a mathematical model of whether you should expect to like your partner more than yourself. I don\\'t mean this in a moralistic way (\\'thou shalt love thy parents\\'), tho that might be another post for another time, or necessarily in a utilitarian way (\"I would rather they get this ice cream than me\"), but as a matter of raw respect (\"I think they\\'re a better person than I am, according to my values\").For simplicity\\'s sake, let\\'s consider everyone as having a \\'stat\\' vector and a \\'preferences\\' vector with the same dimensionality, and giving a candidate partner a \\'score\\' based on the dot product of those two vectors. \\xa0We\\'ll assume that all of the stats are universally good (no one ever prefers an uglier partner over a smarter one, tho they might not care about physical attractiveness much). The preferences vector we\\'ll normalize to have unit magnitude (so it\\'s just an angle in N-dimensional space, basically, defined as a point on the positive sector of the N-spherical shell). For reasons, I\\'ll run simulations with the stat vector as 6 dimensions with 3d6 per stat, leading to a discrete distribution a bit like a truncated normal, with no correlation between the stats.[2]Let\\'s start by considering the heterosexual version of the stable marriage problem, in which people partner up using the well-known Gale-Shapley algorithm, and a simulation with 1,000 each of randomly sampled men and women. Mating is highly assortative; a correlation between total stats of 85.7%, with 83.3% of people have an average total stat difference of less than 6 (the dimensionality).The interesting result is that 91% of people like their partner at least as much as they like themselves, with an average net satisfaction of 1.24. Note that we haven\\'t baked in any correlation between one\\'s stats and one\\'s preferences, and so this result is, in some sense, not very surprising. The preferences are exerting pressure on the partner (thru who you can stably match with) and not exerting pressure on the self, and so you should expect that pressure to result in higher other-satisfaction.[3]So let\\'s add an adjustment to the preferences with a scalable parameter corr, so that now it\\'s the (renormalized) sum of the stat vector (times corr) and the previous preference vector (times abs(1 - corr)). As we smoothly vary this from 0 to 1, the average net satisfaction decreases to -0.2 (liking themselves more than their partner) and the fraction happier decreases to 21%.\\xa0While the change in net satisfaction is relatively smooth, the change in fraction happier looks much more sigmoidal, with the main drop between corr = 0.4 and corr = 0.8. The main change here is in self-satisfaction, which increases by about 5 points while other-satisfaction increases by only about 3 points.You can also imagine situations where people specifically want their complements, rather than their mirror. Negative correlations between your stats and your preferences seem unlikely; a more appropriate model seems to be something like relationship satisfaction being a function of the minimum stat between the two partners (or the minimum plus half the maximum, or so on).The \\'marriage\\' situation with full bisexuality is typically called the stable roommate problem, solved with a similar algorithm. I\\'ll leave it as an exercise for the reader how that impacts the results.[4]\\xa0Anyway, my sense is that when people talk about their \\'better half\\', they\\'re mostly being serious, and this is something that can easily be symmetric.^On Imgur, it\\'s common for cat owners to end posts that collect images of use for some other reason with a picture of their cat, referred to as the \\'cat tax\\'.^Of course in the real world, everything is correlated; not only is there g for intelligence, but GFP for personality, and wealth causes many material factors to be correlated, and so on. You could try to rationalize this by splitting out the \\'natural\\' variables (like intelligence and wealth) into corrected variables (like intelligence and intelligence-adjusted wealth), but then it seems odd to have a uniformly random preference vector (as intelligence in the intelligence-adjusted model is more important than in the non-intelligence-adjusted model, given that some wealth-preference has now been moved over to intelligence). I currently don\\'t expect that taking this into account will affect the analysis much (tho doing the analysis with univariate Gaussian stats leads to some odd effects with self-satisfaction, which I\\'m avoiding here to keep things simple).^Correlation between stats and self-satisfaction, of course, is high (0.69), because we insisted that the preferences all be positive, and so people with higher stats will like themselves more accordingly.^Naively, I would expect that everyone is more satisfied with their relationships (as they can sample from a wider pool). I think it\\'s likely more assortative in terms of total stats, but it\\'s a little unclear what will happen with the similarity (as corr increases) and what will happen to the crossover point of average net satisfaction (but I\\'d guess the 0 point is a bit to the right, with the \\'increased satisfaction\\' effect swamping the \\'when you try for people similar to you, you can get closer\\' effect).',\n",

your solution is available here. \\xa0This also presents the thrilling* conclusion to the story, with a wide variety** of skillfully-written* endings depending on your actions***!*Maybe. \\xa0 \\xa0**Five. \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0***And on your luck.Full generation code is also available here if you are interested, or you can read on and find out.RULESETAn SCP object has a Value and a Danger.When an object is successfully stolen, Marshall Carter & Dark security teams attempt to reduce its costs, while MC&D sales teams attempt to maximize revenue gained.\\xa0Revenue gained starts at a baseline of $2MM * (Value^2). \\xa0This is multiplied by (3+1d6)/6 depending on performance of sales team.Costs start at a baseline of $2MM * (Danger^2). \\xa0This is multiplied by (9-1d6)/6 depending on performance of security team.Profit is equal to Revenue minus Costs.Overall, an object whose Value equals its Danger will average a slight profit. \\xa0Objects with Value > Danger will tend to generate profits, while those with Danger > Value will tend to generate losses.The squaring of Value and Danger means that e.g. Value 6 Danger 5 is much more profitable than Value 1 Danger 0 (with a baseline of $72 MM revenue and $50 MM costs being much better than a baseline of $2 MM revenue and $0 costs).You have very good insight into the Danger of an object via the SCP Foundation's classifications:Any object with Danger 5+ is classified as Keter.Any object with Danger 3-4 is classified as Euclid.Any object with Danger 0-2 is classified as Safe.There was low-hanging-fruit available in preferentially targeting Safe objects (though this was not always optimal). \\xa0The more difficult problem was figuring out how to use tags to identify objects with high Value.However, there were also two Anomalies hidden in the dataset - SCPs that broke the usual rules. \\xa0If you fed the data into a machine learning program without sanity-checking it first (cough), these may have shot you in the foot.ANOMALIESTwo SCPs in the dataset were anomalous - they did not operate under the same rules as the rest of the data, and instead existed as horrible tricks to sabotage people who did not sanity-check their data.SCP-1182 is an infohazardous object. \\xa0All data pertaining to it is corrupted, taking on false values. \\xa0Rows for this object showed up with:A random other date.A random other SCP object's ID.A random location other than its actual location of Site 2.A random classification other than its actual classification of Keter (so Safe or Euclid at random).All flags set incorrectly (listing it as having every property except for 'infohazardous')If no team was sent, a random team will be listed as having been sent - if a team was sent, a random other team or 'none' will be listed.Since the object has never been stolen (in part because any team sent to retrieve it went to the wrong place) the correct value in the profit column is always 0 - this will be replaced with a random non-zero profit value.SCP-537 is a Very Loyal Robot Dog. \\xa0It imprints on its owner (currently Foundation Senior Researcher Valdez on Site 2). \\xa0When its owner calls to it, it returns to them - regardless of its current location, whether it is constrained, or even whether it has been disassembled or destroyed. \\xa0The SCP Foundation is aware of this ability, and uses it to their advantage - they conceal its precise ability, but ensure that potential thieves are aware of it. \\xa0MC&D has stolen it half a dozen times under different heads of Acquisitions, and every time it has returned itself (leaving MC&D with zero profit).DATASETThe remainder of the dataset was generated according to a consistent ruleset. \\xa0The central theme of this dataset was Bayesian inference.There are four possible Sources for anomalous objects:SCP SOURCESCREATORS (e.g. Dr. Wondertainment) produce anomalous objects to accomplish something. \\xa0These objects are designed to be useful, and while they may be dangerous the danger is a side-effect of a desired function.An SCP object produced by a Creator rolls 1d5 and 1d3. \\xa0The 1d5 result is its Danger. \\xa0The sum of both results is its Value.This means that SCP objects produced by Creators will always be valuable, and will be more valuable the more dangerous they are (since Value 7 Danger 5 is better than Value 3 Danger 1).SPACETIME SHENANIGANS (e.g. objects that have fallen through time portals from future or parallel universes) are valuable as mechanisms that can be worked with and sometimes even reverse-engineered.An SCP object resulting from Spacetime Shenanigans rolls 1d6 for its Danger, and has a constant Value of 5.This means that SCP objects resulting from Spacetime Shenanigans will usually be profitable, and more so the less dangerous they are.ANART OBJECTS are produced by 'anomalous artists' who create curiosities. \\xa0In most cases these are neither particularly dangerous nor particularly valuable - they're created by people who are trying to make something artistic, not something useful.An SCP object resulting from anartists rolls 12d6. \\xa0Its Value is equal to the number of 6s rolled and its Danger is equal to the number of 1s rolled.This means that SCP anart objects are usually not very valuable, though low-danger ones are usually slightly profitable.VILLAINS (e.g. the Disciples of the Scarlet King, the Church of the Broken God) are trying to use anomalous means to destroy the world/conquer the world/immanentize the eschaton. \\xa0These objects are designed to be dangerous.An SCP object produced by a Villain rolls 1d4 and 1d5. \\xa0The 1d4 result is its Value. \\xa0The sum of both results is its Danger.This means that SCP objects produced by Villains are never a good idea to pursue.Expected profit from an object based on source and classification:\\xa0CreatorSpacetimeAnartVillainSafe$24.0M$49.6M$9.8M-$5.2MEuclid$44.4M$31.3M-$10.9M-$15.9MKeter$61.8M-$1.7M-$44.7M-$58.5MYour overall goal, therefore, is to identify and pursue Creator-made objects (especially high-danger) and Spacetime-made objects (especially low-danger) while trying to avoid Anart and especially Villain-sourced objects.TAGSTags are not directly relevant to Value or Danger. \\xa0Instead, Tags are informative about Value and Danger by being informative about Source. \\xa0Different sources have different probabilities of exhibiting a given tag:TagCreatorsSpacetimeAnartistsVillainsHumanoid40%10%1%10%Infohazardous20%20%40%10%Location15%1%50%10%Organic50%1%10%15%Predatory15%5%5%30%Mechanical1%60%10%20%Mobile50%40%5%40%Replicating1%20%5%30%Virtual5%40%30%1%For a given source, tags are independent of one another (with the exception of Humanoid and Location, which are mutually exclusive).A full analysis of what tags imply what is quite deep. \\xa0A few sample things to point out:'Predatory' is generally a bad tag to see.'Organic' and 'Mechanical' are both good tags in isolation (with Organic tending to mean something that came from a Creator and Mechanical tending to mean something that came from Spacetime). \\xa0However, Organic and Mechanical together are quite bad: as Creators very rarely make Mechanical things and Spacetime very rarely produces Organic things, this tends to mean something that has both those traits came from a Villain.'Virtual' objects very rarely come from Villains, and usually come from either Spacetime or Anart. \\xa0This means that low-danger Virtual objects are usually pretty good bets.'Mobile' is strong evidence against Anart - this is good to see if you have e.g. a Virtual object, which you're already fairly sure is either Spacetime or Anart. \\xa0It's pretty much meaningless if you're trying to figure out whether a Predatory Organic Humanoid (already extremely unlikely to be Anart) is from a Villain or a Creator.Tags also had a secondary effect on retrieval teams:Location SCPs cannot be stolen by Infiltration teams (your infiltration teams are not Carmen Sandiego).Humanoid SCPs cannot be stolen by Legal teams (even if MC&D could convince a court to assign them title to a person and compel the Foundation to hand them over, the PR risk would be too high, and your lawyers will not do it).Virtual SCPs cannot be stolen by Paramilitary teams (even if you run off with the computers, Foundation data security and backup tech is very reliable and your paramilitary operatives are not trained to work around it).Your predecessors knew the first two of these things, and did not send Infiltration teams after Locations or Legal teams after Humanoids. \\xa0They did not know the third, and frequently sent Paramilitary teams to fail in retrieving Virtual SCPs.EDITED TO ADD: Aside from their dependence on tags, your predecessors' actions were almost entirely random, sending 2 teams of each type plus 1-5 additional random teams (1d3 at first, up to 1d4 in 1950 and 1d5 in 2000) to target random SCP objects.LOCATIONSThere were six sites in-game. \\xa0Site 1 is Foundation overall administration and headquarters, SCP objects are not stored there. \\xa0There is no Site 5. \\xa0You are not cleared to know what happened to Site 5. \\xa0Do not enquire further. \\xa0Be vg jvyy unccra gb lbh.These had a relationship with Sources:Creators operate mostly in Europe and Asia (Site 4: Moscow and Site 6: Geneva). \\xa0Creator-made objects are twice as likely to appear here as in other areas.The Anart scene is most active around Site 2: Washington D.C. and Site 7: Shanghai. \\xa0Anart-made objects are twice as likely to appear here as in other areas.Spacetime shenanigans tend to happen most near the equatorial portal zone, near Site 3: Kinshasa and Site 8: Tehran. \\xa0Spacetime-sourced objects are twice as likely to appear here as in other areas.They also had a modest effect on retrieval teams:Paramilitary teams work best in regions lacking a strong and protective centralized governance with an effective monopoly on force. \\xa0They have (when dealing with non-Virtual objects) a 90% success rate near Kinshasa and Tehran, a 60% success rate the rest of the time.Legal teams work best in regions with a governance that is maximally responsive to MC&D's influence. \\xa0They have (when dealing with non-Humanoid objects) a 90% success rate near Shanghai and Moscow, a 60% success rate the rest of the time.Infiltration teams have cultivated contacts in the areas where other teams function less well. \\xa0They have (when dealing with non-Location objects) a 90% success rate near Geneva and Washington D.C, a 60% success rate the rest of the time.STRATEGYWith a theoretical perfect understanding of how the system works, optimal strategy is to:Use Bayesian inference on tags, locations, and classification to predict which sources are likely for any given object.Attempt to steal preferentially high-danger objects produced by Creators, and low-danger objects produced by Spacetime. \\xa0(If attempting to minimize profit, instead attempt to steal high-danger objects produced by Villains.)Send the correct team type to each object.The SCP objects you had access to, their source probabilities with evidence taken into account, and the resulting expected profits,

I sometimes get asked how I do this, which might just be people making fun of me, but I choose to interpret it as a real question, and I’m going to sketch an answer here. \\n\\n\\nYou can think of this as a sort of sequel to Minimal-Trust Investigations. That piece talked about how investigating things in depth can be valuable; this piece will try to give a sense of how to get an in-depth investigation off the ground, going from “I’ve never heard of this topic before” to “Let me tell you all my thoughts on that.”\\n\\n\\nThe rough basic idea is that I organize my learning around writing rather than reading. This doesn’t mean I don’t read - just that the reading is always in service of the writing. \\n\\n\\nHere’s an outline:\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n       \\n    \\n    \\n   Step 1\\n   \\n   Pick a topic\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 2\\n   \\n   Read and/or discuss with others (a bit)\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 3\\n   \\n   Explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis, in writing (or conversation)\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 4\\n   \\n   Find and list weaknesses in my case\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 5\\n   \\n   Pick a subquestion and do more reading/discussing\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 6\\n   \\n   Revise my claim / switch sides\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 7\\n   \\n   Repeat steps 3-6 a bunch\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   Step 8\\n   \\n   Get feedback on a draft from others, and use this to keep repeating steps 3-6\\n   \\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    \\nThe “traditionally” hard parts of this process are steps 4 and 6: spotting weaknesses in arguments, trying to resist the temptation to “stick to my guns” when my original hypothesis isn’t looking so good, etc. \\n\\n\\nBut step 3 is a different kind of challenge: trying to “always have a hypothesis” and re-articulating it whenever it changes. By doing this, I try to continually focus my reading on the goal of forming a bottom-line view, rather than just “gathering information.” I think this makes my investigations more focused and directed, and the results easier to retain. I consider this approach to be probably the single biggest difference-maker between \"reading a ton about lots of things, but retaining little\" and \"efficiently developing a set of views on key topics and retaining the reasoning behind them.\"\\n\\nBelow I\\'ll give more detail on each step, then some brief notes (to be expanded on later) on why this process is challenging.\\nMy process for learning by writing\\n\\nStep 1: pick a topic. First, I decide what I want to form an opinion about. My basic approach here is: “Find claims that are important if true, and might be true.” \\n\\n\\nThis doesn’t take creativity. We live in an ocean of takes, pundits, advocates, etc. I usually cheat by paying special attention to claims by people who seem particularly smart, interesting, unconventionally minded (not repeating the same stuff I hear everywhere), and interested in the things I’m interested in (such as the long-run future of humanity). \\n\\n\\nBut I also tend to be at least curious about any claim that is both “important if true” and “not obviously wrong according to some concrete reason I can voice,” even if it’s coming from a very random source (Youtube commenter, whatever).\\n\\n\\nFor a concrete example throughout this piece, I’ll use this hypothesis, which I examined pretty recently: “Human history is a story of life getting gradually, consistently better.”\\n\\n\\n(Other, more complicated examples are the Collapsing Civilizational Competence Hypothesis; the Most Important Century hypothesis; and my attempt to summarize history in one table.)\\n\\n\\nStep 2: read and/or discuss (a bit). I usually start by trying to read the most prominent 1-3 pieces that (a) defend the claim or (b) attack the claim or (c) set out to comprehensively review the evidence on both sides. I try to understand the major reasons they’re giving for the side they come down on. I also chat about the topic with people who know more about it than I do, and who aren’t too high-stakes to chat with.\\n\\n\\nIn the example I’m using, I read the relevant parts of Better Angels of our Nature and Enlightenment Now (focusing on claims about life getting better, and skipping discussion of “why”). I then looked for critiques of the books that specifically responded to the claims about life having gotten better (again putting aside the “why”).  This led mostly to claims about the peacefulness of hunter-gatherers.\\n\\n\\nStep 3: explain and defend my current, incredibly premature hypothesis, in writing (or conversation). This is where my approach gets unusual - I form a hypothesis about whether the claim is true, LONG before I’m “qualified to have an opinion.” The process looks less like “Read and digest everything out there on the topic” and more like “Read the 1-3 most prominent pieces on each side, then go.”\\n\\n\\nI don’t have an easy time explaining “how” I generate a hypothesis while knowing so little - it feels like I just always have a “guess” at the answer to some topic, whether or not I even want to (though it often takes me a lot of effort to articulate the guess in words). The main thing I have to say about the “how” is that it just doesn’t matter: at this stage the hypothesis is more about setting the stage for more questions about investigation than about really trying to be right, so it seems sufficient to “just start rambling onto the page, and make any corrections/edits that my current state of knowledge already forces.”\\n\\n\\nFor this example, I noted down something along the lines of: “Life has gotten better throughout history. The best data on this comes from the last few hundred years, because before that we just didn’t keep many records. Sometimes people try to claim that the longest-ago, murkiest times were better, such as hunter-gatherer times, but there’s no evidence for this - in fact, empirical evidence shows that hunter-gatherers were very violent - and we should assume that these early times fit on the same general trendline, which would mean they were quite bad. (Also, if you go even further back than hunter-gatherers, you get to apes, whose lives seem really horrible, so that seems to fit the trend as well.1)” \\n\\n\\nIt took real effort to disentangle the thoughts in my head to the point where I could write that, but I tried to focus on keeping things simple and not trying to get it perfect.\\n\\n\\nAt this stage, this is not a nuanced, caveated, detailed or well-researched take. Instead, my approach is more like: “Try to state what I think in a pretty strong, bold manner; defend it aggressively; list all of the best counterarguments, and shoot them down.” This generally fails almost immediately.\\n\\n\\nStep 4: find and list weaknesses in my case. My next step is to play devil’s advocate against myself, such as by:\\n\\n\\n\\nLooking for people arguing things that contradict my working hypothesis, and looking for their strongest points.\\n\\nNoting claims I’ve made with this property: “I haven’t really made an attempt to look comprehensively at the arguments on both sides of this, and if I did I might change my mind.”\\n\\n\\n(This summary obscures an ocean of variation. Having more existing knowledge about a general area, and more experience with investigations in general, can make someone much better at noticing things like this.)\\n\\n\\nIn the example, my “devil’s advocate” points included:\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m getting all of my “life has gotten better” charts from books that are potentially biased. I should do something to see whether there are other charts, excluded from those books, that tell the opposite story.\\n\\nFrom my brief skim, the “hunter-gatherers were violent” claim looks right, and the critiques seem very hand-wavy and non-data-based. But I should probably read them more carefully and pull out their strongest arguments.\\n\\nEven if hunter-gatherers were violent, what about other aspects of their lives? Wikipedia seems to have a pretty rosy picture …\\n\\n\\nIn theory, I could swap Step 4 (listing things I’d like to look into more) with Step 3 (writing what I think). That is, I could try to review both sides of every point comprehensively before forming my own view, which means a lot more reading before I start writing. \\n\\n\\nI think many people try to do this, but in my experience at least, it’s not the best way to go. \\n\\n\\n\\nDebates tend to be many-dimensional: for example, “Has life gotten better?” quickly breaks down into “Has quality-of-life metric X gotten better over period Y?” for a whole bunch of different X-Y pairs (plus other questions2). \\n\\nSo if my goal were “Understand both sides of every possible sub-debate,” I could be reading forever - for example, I might get embroiled in the debates and nuances around each different claim made about life getting better over the last few hundred years. \\n\\nBy writing early, I get a chance to make sure I’ve written down the version of the claim I care most about, and make sure that any further investigation is focused on the things that matter most for changing my mind on this claim.  \\n\\n \\nOnce I wrote down “There are a huge number of charts showing that life has gotten better over the last few hundred years,” I could see that deep-diving any particular one of those charts wouldn’t be the best use of time - compared to addressing the very weakest points in the claim I had written, by going back further in time to hunter-gatherer periods, or looking for entirely different collections of charts.\\n\\n\\n\\nStep 5: pick a subquestion and do more reading and/or discussing. One of the most important factors that determines whether these investigations go well (in the sense of teaching me a lot relatively quickly) is deciding which subquestions to “dig into” and which not to. As just noted, writing the hypothesis down early is key. \\n\\n\\nI try to stay very focused on doing the reading (and/or low-stakes discussion) most likely to change the big-picture claim I’m making. I rarely read a book or paper “once from start to finish”; instead I energetically skip around trying to find the parts most likely to give me a solid reason to change my mind, read them carefully and often multiple times, try to figure out what else I should be reading (whether this is “other parts of the same document” or “academic papers on topic X”) to contextualize them, etc.\\n\\n\\nStep 6: Revise my claim / switch sides. This is one of the trickiest parts - pausing Step 5 as soon as I have a modified (often still simplified, under-researched and wrong) hypothesis. It’s hard to notice when my hypothesis changes, and hard to stay open to radical changes of direction (and I make no claim that I’m as good at it as I could be).\\n\\n\\nI often try radically flipping around my hypothesis, even if I haven’t actually been convinced that it’s wrong - sometimes when I’m feeling iffy about arguing for one side, it’s productive to just go ahead and try arguing for the other side. I tend to get further by noticing how I feel about the \"best arguments for both sides\" than by trying from the start to be even-handed. \\n\\n\\nIn the example, I pretty quickly decided to try flipping my view around completely, and noted something like: “A lot of people assume life has gotten better over time, but that’s just the last few hundred years. In fact, our best guess is that hunter-gatherers were getting some really important things right, such as gender relations and mental health, that we still haven’t caught up to after centuries of progress. Agriculture killed that, and we’ve been slowly climbing out of a hole ever since. There should be tons more research on what hunter-gatherer societies are/were like, and whether we can replicate their key properties at scale today - this is a lot more promising than just continuing to push forward science and technology and modernity.”\\n\\n\\nThis completely contradicted my initial hypothesis. (I now think both are wrong.) \\n\\n\\nThis sent me down a new line of research: constructing the best argument I could that life was better in hunter-gatherer times.\\n\\n\\nStep 7: repeat steps 3-6 a bunch. I tried to gather the best evidence for hunter-gatherer life being good, and for it being bad, and zeroed in on gender relations and violence as particularly interesting, confusing debates; on both of these, I changed my hypothesis/headline several times. \\n\\n\\nMy hypotheses became increasingly complex and detailed, as you can see from the final products: Pre-agriculture gender relations seem bad (which argues that gender relations for hunter-gatherers were/are far from Wikipedia’s rosy picture, according to the best available evidence, though the evidence is far from conclusive, and it’s especially unclear how pre-agriculture gender relations compare to today’s) and Unraveling the evidence about violence among very early humans (which argues that hunter-gatherer violence was indeed high, but that - contra Better Angels - it probably got even worse after the development of agriculture, before declining at some pretty unknown point before today).\\n\\n\\nI went through several cycles of “I think I know what I really think and I’m ready to write,” followed by “No, having started writing, I’m unsatisfied with my answer on this point and think a bit more investigation could change it.” So I kept alternating between writing and reading, but was always reading with the aim of getting back to writing.\\n\\n\\nI finally produced some full, opinionated drafts that seemed to me to be about the best I could do without a ton more work.\\n\\n\\nAfter I had satisfied myself on these points, I popped back up from the “hunter-gatherer” question to the original question of whether life has gotten better over time. I followed a similar process for investigating other subquestions, like “Is the set of charts I’ve found representative for the last few hundred years?” and “What about the period in between hunter-gatherer times and the last few hundred years?”\\n\\n\\nStep 8: add feedback from others into the loop. It takes me a long time to get to the point where I can no longer easily tear apart my own hypothesis. Once I do, I start seeking feedback from others - first just people I know who are likely to be helpful and interested in the topic, then experts and the public. This works the same basic way as Steps 4-7, but with others doing a lot of the “noticing weaknesses” part (Step 4).\\n\\n\\nWhen I publish, I am thinking of it more like “I can’t easily find more problems with this, so it’s time to see whether others can” than like “This is great and definitely right.”\\n\\nI hope I haven’t made this sound fun or easy\\n\\n\\n\\nSome things about this process that are hard, taxing, exhausting and a bit of a mental health gauntlet:\\n\\n\\n\\nI constantly have a feeling (after reading) like I know what I think and how to say it, then I start writing and immediately notice that I don’t at all. I need to take a lot of breaks and try a lot of times to even “write what I currently think,” even when it’s pretty simple and early.\\n\\nEvery subquestion is something I could spend a lifetime learning about, if I chose to. I need to constantly interrupt myself and ask, “Is this a key point? Is this worth learning more about?” or else I’ll never finish.\\n\\nThere are infinite tough judgment calls about things like “whether to look into some important-seeming point, or just reframe my hypothesis such that I don’t need to.” Sometimes the latter is the answer (it feels like some debate is important, but if I really think about it, I realize the thing I most care about can be argued for without getting to the bottom of it); sometimes the former is (it feels like I can try to get around some debate, but actually, I can’t really come to a reasonable conclusion without an exhausting deep dive). \\n\\nAt any given point, I know that if I were just better at things like “noticing which points are really crucial” and “reformulating my hypothesis so that it’s easier to defend while still important,” I could probably do something twice as good in half the time … and I often realize after a massive deep dive that most of the time I spent wasn’t necessary.\\n\\nBecause of these points, I have very little ability to predict when a project will be done; I am never confident that I’m doing it as well as I could; and I’m constantly interrupting myself to reflect on these things rather than getting into a flow.\\n\\nHalf the time, all of this work just ends up with me agreeing with conventional wisdom or “the experts” anyway … so I’ve just poured in work and gone through a million iterations of changing my mind, and any random person I talk to about it will just be like “So you decided X? Yeah X is just what I had already assumed.”\\n\\nThe whole experience is a mix of writing, Googling, reading, skimming, and pressuring myself to be more efficient, which is very different and much more unpleasant compared to the experience of just reading. (Among other things, I can read in a nice location and be looking at a book or e-ink instead of a screen. Most of the work of an “investigation” is in front of a glowing screen and requires an Internet connection.)\\n\\n\\nI’ll write more about these challenges in a future post. I definitely recommend reading as a superior leisure activity, but for me at least, writing-centric work seems better for learning.\\n\\n\\nI’m really interested in comments from anyone who tries this sort of thing out and has things to share about how it goes!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n\\xa0Comment/discuss\\n\\n\\n\\nFootnotes\\n\\n\\n\\n     I never ended up using this argument about apes. I think it’s probably mostly right, but there’s a whole can of worms with claims about loving, peaceful bonobos that I never quite got motivated to get to the bottom of. \\xa0↩\\n\\n\\n     Such as which metrics are most important.\\xa0↩\\n\\n',\n",

John Taylor Gatto speaks about this from experience and insight:\\nSeven Lessons Taught in School, 1991\\n(If you\\'re going to read the following, at least read the seven lessons (part I) of that essay.)\\nHere\\'s another list of harms caused by schooling.\\n1. You aren\\'t a mind, and don\\'t bother trying to behave like one.\\nChildren naturally attend to things until they\\'re done with them:\\nFrom Maria Montessori, My System of Education, 1915:\\nIPFS pdf link\\n\\nA little girl, about three years of age, was deeply absorbed in the work of placing wooden blocks and cylinders in a frame for that purpose. The expression of her face was that of such intense attention, that it was almost a revelation to me. Never before had I seen a child look with such \"fixedness\" upon an object, and my conviction about the instability of attention which goes incessantly from one thing to another, a fact which is so characteristic in little children, made the phenomenon the more remarkable to me.\\n\\n\\nI watched the child without interrupting her, and counted how many times she would do her work over and over. It seemed that she was never going to stop. As I saw that it would take a very long time, I took the little armchair on which she was sitting and placed child and chair on the big table. Hastily she put the frame across the chair, gathered blocks and cylinders in her lap, and continued her work undisturbed. I invited the other children to sing, but the little girl went on with her work and continued even after the singing had ceased. I counted forty-four different exercises which she made, and when she finally stopped, and did so absolutely independently from an exterior cause that could disturb her, she looked around with an expression of great satisfaction, as if she were awakening from a deep and restful sleep.\\n\\n\\nThe impression I received from the observation was that of a discovery. The same phenomenon became very common among those children, and it was noticed in every school in every country where my system was introduced; therefore it can be considered as a constant reaction which takes place in connection with certain exterior conditions that can be well established. Each time a similar \"polarization\" of the attention occurred, the child began to transmute itself completely; it became calmer, more expressive, more intelligent, and evidenced extraordinary interior qualities, which recalled the phenomena of the highest mentality. When the phenomenon of polarization of the attention had occurred, all that was confused and drifting in the conscience of the child seemed to assume a form, the marvelous characters of which were reproduced in each individual.\\n\\nSchool usually steamrolls this process. The teacher has dominion over your attention; you have to either listen to what the teacher is saying, or work on the worksheets. Your location and (nominal) topic switches every hour. Even at home you do worksheets and projects. Your attention isn\\'t you or yours; you\\'re at war with your attention, it says no but your teacher--and implicitly your parents and college admissions and society, and \"you\"--insist.\\nNot only are you not the authority on what is worth it for you to spend minutes, days, or years on; if you are even consulted, it\\'s superficial (\"Which current event to do a report on? There are many options.\") and maybe only for Potemkin village purposes (\"We offer many electives.\"). You have to be a receptacle for what the teacher has brought to give you, because you don\\'t have a perspective, you aren\\'t an organized/organizing entity, and therefore can\\'t be trusted to judge what is worthwhile. In the teacher-student relationship, someone has to defer to the other, and there\\'s nothing in the student that the teacher could defer to. (I recall my elementary school art teacher looking at my painting, and then taking the brush out of my hand and painting new stuff on the canvas over what I\\'d already put there. In another class, I said \"Wait, [...]\" because I was confused about something, and the teacher interrupted my question to scold me for telling zer what to do.) Simply, the time in which you\\'d have created your mind is taken from you.\\nThis creates learned helplessness about being absorbed in anything. It\\'s like if you are trying to program, or write, but at arbitrary moments, someone Harrison Bergerons you until you forget what you were thinking. You learn not to get all worked up (absorbed in something, arranged ephemerally but suitably for the matter at hand, like a standing wave or a rough-and-ready scaffolding), because you\\'ll just have to drop it in the middle anyway. You minimize the deepness and recursiveness of your questions, the length of your strides into the woods; the deeper the question, the more at risk you are of building towers of mental context and pumping neuroplasticity-juice into the relevant areas of your mind, and then having that plasticity act as random brain damage rather than successful reprogramming, when [the task that the plasticity was aimed at taking a compressive snapshot of how to perform/complete] is interrupted.\\nThe self-organization of the child\\'s mind is blocked at every turn, and the results are similar to trying to gestate a fetus in a small box.\\nAlways smile. Refrain from looking out of the window.\\n2. The world isn\\'t yours.\\n2.1. We own Space, and decide where you are.\\nBeing forced to stay in a room with restricted range of motion (stay in your seat and stop fidgeting) is captivity, and captivity is harmful. Nuff said, one might have hoped.\\nA common episode: a student asks \"Can I go to the bathroom?\", and the teacher responds \"You CAN, but you MAY not.\" or \"You CAN, did you mean \\'May I?\\'?\". It\\'s not just a stupid joke (what other stupid jokes stick out as vividly in memory as this one?), it\\'s rubbing in your face that your range of motion is restricted by authority as if there were a concrete wall instead of a door, but you\\'re not allowed to bring to the teacher\\'s attention that they are restraining you so severely. Wow, what a doofus you are to think that Can and May are the same, how could you possibly have gotten those confused, I wonder?\\nFrom The Quiet Rooms, Richards, Cohen, Chavis, 2019:\\nTL;DR: Many thousands of times a year, kids in Illinois are locked up in a small room alone, sometimes for hours.\\n\\nIn Illinois, it\\'s legal for school employees to seclude students in a separate space — to put them in \"isolated timeout\" — if the students pose a safety threat to themselves or others. Yet every school day, workers isolate children for reasons that violate the law[...] [snip]\\n\\n\\nFor this investigation, ProPublica Illinois and the Tribune obtained and analyzed thousands of detailed records that state law requires schools to create whenever they use seclusion. The resulting database documents more than 20,000 incidents from the 2017-18 school year and through early December 2018. [snip]\\n\\n\\n\"Please, please, please open the door. Please, I\\'ll be good. Open the door and I\\'ll be quiet.\"\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'d rather die.

Presumably in other states as well.\\nAutistic 11 year old locked in a small room alone for hours in the UK: \"He had always loved school... but by the end of October in fifth class he hated it. I was dragging him into school every day.\"\\nNo kidding.\\nIt sounds not uncommon in the UK: Consequence Rooms. \"Then he got 22 hours in an isolation booth in one week and he was just an absolute mess.

MAY go.\\nFrom Children\\'s Games in Street and Playground, Opie and Opie, 1969: IPFS pdf link\\nTL;DR: Kids in confinement are more violent and cruel than kids not in confinement.\\n\\nThe places specially made for children\\'s play are also the places where children can most easily be watched playing: the asphalt expanses of school playgrounds, the cage-like enclosures filled with junk by a local authority, the corners of recreation grounds stocked with swings and slides. In a playground children are, or are not, allowed to make chalk diagrams on the ground for hopscotch, to bounce balls against a wall, to bring marbles or skipping ropes, to play \\'Conkers\\', \\'Split the Kipper\\', \\'Hi Jimmy Knacker\\'. Children of different ages may or may not be kept apart; boys may or may not be separated from girls. And according to the closeness of the supervision they organize gangs, carry out vendettas, place people in Coventry, gamble, bribe, blackmail, squabble, bully, and fight. The real nature of young boys has long been apparent to us, or so it has seemed. We have only to travel in a crowded school bus to be conscious of their belligerency, the extraordinary way they have of assailing each other, verbally and physically, each child feeling—perhaps with reason—that it is necessary to keep his end up against the rest. We know from accounts of previous generations with what good reason the great boarding schools, and other schools following, limited boys\\' free time, and made supervised games a compulsory part of the curriculum. As Sydney Smith wrote in 1810, it had become an \\'immemorial custom\\' in the public schools that every boy should be alternately tyrant and slave. [snip for length; more descriptions of abuse by kids in school]\\n\\n\\n[snip] [...]leading us [educators] to believe that a Lord of the Flies mentality is inherent in the young[...] [snip]\\n\\n\\nThus recent extensive studies of apes and monkeys have shown, perhaps not unexpectedly, that animal behaviour in captivity is not the same as in the wild. In the natural habitat the welfare of the troop as a whole is paramount, the authority of the experienced animal is accepted, the idiosyncrasies of members of the troop are respected. But when the same species is confined and overcrowded the toughest and least-sensitive animal comes to the top, a pecking order develops, bullying and debauchery become common, and each creature when abused takes his revenge on the creature next weakest to himself. In brief, it appears that when lower primates are in the wild, and fending for themselves, their behaviour is \\'civilized\\', certainly in comparison with their behaviour when they are confined and cared for, which is when they most behave \\'like animals\\'.\\n\\n\\nOur observations of children lead us to believe that much the same is true of our own species. We have noticed that when children are herded together in the playground, which is where the educationalists and the psychologists and the social scientists gather to observe them, their play is markedly more aggressive than when they are in the street or in the wild places. At school they play \\'Ball He\\', \\'Dodge Ball\\', \\'Chain Swing\\', and \\'Bull in the Ring\\'. They indulge in duels such as \\'Slappies\\', \\'Knuckles\\', and \\'Stinging\\', in which the pleasure, if not the purpose, of the game is to dominate another player and inflict pain. In a playground it is impracticable to play the free-ranging games like \\'Hide and Seek\\' and \\'Relievo\\' and \\'Kick the Can\\', that are, as Stevenson said, the \\'well-spring of romance\\', and are natural to children in the wastelands. Often, when we have asked children what games they played in the playground we have been told \\'We just go round aggravating people.\\' [snip; more descriptions of abusive games]\\n\\n\\nSuch behaviour would not be tolerated amongst the players in the street or the wasteland; and for a long time we had difficulty reconciling these accounts with the thoughtfulness and respect for the juvenile code that we had noticed in the quiet places. Then we recollected how, in our own day, children who had seemed unpleasant at school (whose term-time behaviour at boarding school had indeed been barbarous), turned out to be surprisingly civilized when we met them in the holidays. We remembered hearing how certain inmates of institutions, and even people in concentration camps during the war, far from having a feeling of camaraderie, were liable to seek their pleasure in making life still more intolerable for those who were confined with them [...].\\n\\n2.2. We own people, and decide who you\\'re with.\\nYou\\'re segregated by age, and divided in classes. Maybe you\\'d\\'ve learned to learn from a kid a couple years older than you, or learned to teach a kid a couple years younger than you. But that\\'s hypothetical, because we\\'ve decided you\\'re not to be with those people.\\n2.3. We own Import.\\nIn standard schooling, kids aren\\'t around adults in adult environments doing adult activities for adult reasons. There\\'s the real world, the adult world, where everything of Import is, and then there\\'s the kid world, which has to make way for the adult world.\\nFrom Children\\'s Games in Street and Playground, Opie and Opie, 1969: IPFS pdf link\\n\\nWhat is curious about these embroilments is that children always do seem to have been in trouble about the places where they played. In the nineteenth century there were repeated complaints that the pavements of London were made impassable by children\\'s shuttlecock and tipcat. In Stuart times, Richard Steele reported, the vicinity of the Royal Exchange was infested with uninvited sportsmen, and a beadle was employed to whip away the \"unlucky Boys with Toys and Balls\". Even in the Middle Ages, when it might be supposed a meadow was within reach of every Jack and Jill in Britain, the young had a way of gravitating to unsuitable places. In 1332 it was found necessary to prohibit boys and others from playing in the precincts of the Palace at Westminster while Parliament was sitting. In 1385 the Bishop of London was forced to declaim against the ball-play about St. Paul\\'s; and in 1447, away in Devonshire, the Bishop of Exeter was complaining of \\'yong Peple\\' playing in the cloister, even during divine service, such games as \\'the toppe, queke, penny prykke, and most atte tenys, by the which the walles of the saide Cloistre have be defowled and the glas wyndowes all to brost\\'.\\n\\n\\nShould such persistent choice of busy and provocative play-places alert us that all is not as appears in the ghettos of childhood? Children\\'s deepest pleasure, as we shall see, is to be away in the wastelands, yet they do not care to separate themselves altogether from the adult world. In some forms of their play (or in certain moods), they seem deliberately to attract attention to themselves, screaming, scribbling on the pavements, smashing milk bottles, banging on doors, and getting in people\\'s way. A single group of children were able to name twenty games they played which involved running across the road. Are children, in some of their games, expressing something more than high spirits, something of which not even they, perhaps, are aware? No section of the community is more rooted to where it lives than the young. When children engage in \\'Last Across\\' in front of a car is it just devilment that prompts the sport, or may it be some impulse of protest in the tribe? Perhaps those people will appreciate this question most who have asked themselves whether the convenience of motorists thrusting through a town or village is really as important as the well-being of the people whose settlement it is, and who are attempting to live their\\nlives in it.\\n\\nLet yong Peple go!\\nFrom John Taylor Gatto, Dumbing Us Down, 1992: IPFS pdf link\\n\\nIn Monongahela by that river everyone was my teacher. Daily, it seemed to a boy, one of the mile-long trains would stop in town to take on water and coal, or for some mysterious reason; the brakeman and engineer would step among snot-nosed kids and spin railroad yarns, let us run in and out of boxcars, over and under flatcars, tank cars, coal cars, and numbers of other specialty cars whose function we memorized as easily as we memorized enemy plane silhouettes. Once a year, maybe, we got taken into the caboose that reeked of stale beer to be offered a bologna-on-white-bread sandwich. The anonymous men lectured, advised, and inspired the boys of Monongahela — that was as much their job as driving the trains.\\n\\n\\nSometimes a riverboat would stop in mid-channel and discharge a crew who would row to shore, tying their skiff to one of the willows. That was the excuse for every rickety skiff in the twelve-block-long town to fill up with kids, pulling like Vikings, sometimes with sticks instead of oars, to raid the \"Belle of Pittsburgh\" or \"The Original River Queen.\" Some kind of natural etiquette was at work in Monongahela. The rules didn\\'t need to be written down; if men had time they showed boys how to grow up. We didn\\'t whine when our time was up: men had work to do — we understood that and scampered away, grateful for the flash of our own futures they had had time to reveal, however small it was.\\n\\nThe world isn\\'t yours, it\\'s the adults\\'s. We\\'re driving in our cars on our way to and from important things, and you better get out of the way. They\\'re very important things, they aren\\'t for you, go play (somewhere else).\\nImagining that your activities, explorations, and questions in the classroom could be taken up with the solemn seriousness, open reality, and pivotal consequence of a factory floor, a judge\\'s courtroom, or an artist\\'s studio, is very cute and childlikeish. That I would believe you, is laughable, though I will of course humor you. If the work I give you is comically fake, well did you expect it to be real? You\\'re only a child.\\n3. Preference falsification and double binds.\\n(See Wiki: Double bind, h/t Michael Vassar.)\\nSlavoj Žižek:\\n\\nIt\\'s Sunday afternoon. My father wants me to visit our grandmother. Let\\'s say my father is a traditional authority. What would he be doing? He would probably tell me something like, \"I don\\'t care how you feel; it\\'s your duty to visit your grandmother. Be polite to her and so on.\" Nothing bad about this I claim because I can still rebel and so on. It\\'s a clear order. But what would the so-called post-modern non-authoritarian father do?\\n\\n\\nI know because I experienced it. He would have said something like this, \"You know how much your grandmother loves you, but nonetheless I\\'m not forcing you to visit her. You should only visit her if you freely decide to do it.\" Now every child knows that beneath the appearance of free choice there is a much stronger pressure in this second message. Because basically your father is not only telling you, you must visit your grandmother, but you must love to visit it. You know he tells you how you must feel about it. It\\'s a much stronger order.\\n\\nYour attention is yours (and you must give it to me). Follow your interests (and be interested in what we\\'re \"teaching\"). You want to be good, right? So you want to follow the rules we make, right? And they\\'re rightful rules, aren\\'t they, or why else would you want to follow them? Develop your own unique specialness (make sure it\\'s one of the things on this list though). God help you if you question our authority to deny you bodily autonomy, and you\\'d better pretend that CAN and MAY are meaningfully different here.\\nAlways smile. Refrain from looking out of the window.\\nPossibilities\\nMany of these harms can be alleviated or avoided by just not being crazy. (Yes it\\'s that easy.) It\\'s fine if the kids aren\\'t paying attention to what you\\'re teaching, why are you trying to teach 20 kids at once anyway? If something is truly repulsive to a kid\\'s attention, then you\\'re just wrong about what\\'s good for the kid right now, period. And so on.\\nWhat\\'s left is for teachers (or \"mentors\" or \"guides\" or something) to bring the world to the children. Montessori wrote about this at length. In general, there\\'s much work to be done with teaching; but this is mostly unknown territory, since teachers have mostly so far been obliged to do something other than facilitate learning, and teachers will have to learn how to let the students learn, which is a detailed activity with unknown challenges. Maximize blocks of uninterrupted time. Maximize the environment for opening up the world, deferring to children\\'s interests. Allow the children to make their own environment, like the people that they are.\\nIt would be trivially easy to make school a better product for parents. Have it run until 1720 or later, so parents with work have daycare (kids of course need daycare until they\\'re 18; or at least, that is the revealed preference for whatever reason). Allow flexible sign-in and sign-out. Be completely open to parents visiting. Let kids play outside for many hours, so they aren\\'t stressed, sick, and depressed. Never give homework, so kids can be with their families.\\nI spoke with someone who runs a pre-school in the spirit of Montessori. Ze told me that ze started a Montessori school, but regulations and money problems made it go under. Ze was sure there\\'s a market, though. I suspect (not having carefully evaluated things) that Effective Altruism is severely underweighting the value of investing in education. I think that harming kids makes them grow up to be more likely to harm other people and be less creative. School almost certainly doesn\\'t matter if AGI comes in the next decade or two, but if we have longer, then more rolls of the dice for brilliant natural philosophers seems like maybe a pretty good way to spend resources.\\nContact me at my gmail address, username \"tsvibtcontact\", if you want to discuss with me possible interventions and funding (not that I\\'m well-suited to these tasks or have too much energy for them, but I\\'m interested).\\nNot sure Becky\\'s kidding.\\n',\n",

       " {'text': 'Or “How I got my hyperanalytical friends to chill out and vibe on ideas for 5 minutes before testing them to destruction”\\n\\n\\n\\nSometimes talking with my friends is like intellectual combat, which is great. I am glad I have such strong cognitive warriors on my side. But not all ideas are ready for intellectual combat. If I don’t get my friend on board with this, some of them will crush an idea before it gets a chance to develop, which feels awful and can kill off promising avenues of investigation. It’s like showing a beautiful, fragile butterfly to your friend to demonstrate the power of flight, only to have them grab it and crush it in their hands, then point to the mangled corpse as proof butterflies not only don’t fly, but can’t fly, look how busted their wings are.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou know who you are\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I’m stuck in a conversation like that, it has been really helpful to explicitly label things as butterfly ideas. This has two purposes. First, it’s a shorthand for labeling what I want (nurturance and encouragement). Second, it explicitly labels the idea as not ready for prime time in ways that make it less threatening to my friends. They can support the exploration of my idea without worrying that support of exploration conveys agreement, or agreement conveys a commitment to act.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is important because very few ideas start out ready for the rigors of combat. If they’re not given a sheltered period, they will die before they become useful. This cuts us off from a lot of goodness in the world. Examples:\\n\\n\\n\\nA start-up I used to work for had a keyword that meant “I have a vague worried feeling I want to discuss without justifying”. This let people bring up concerns before they had an ironclad case for them and made statements that could otherwise have felt like intense criticism feel more like information sharing (they’re not asserting this will definitely fail, they’re asserting they have a feeling that might lead to some questions). This in turn meant that problems got brought up and addressed earlier, including problems in the classes “this is definitely gonna fail and we need to make major changes” and\\xa0 “this excellent idea but Bob is missing the information that would help him understand why”.This keyword was “FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt)”. It is used in exactly the opposite way in cryptocurrency circles, where it means “you are trying to increase our anxiety with unfounded concerns, and that’s bad”. Words are tricky.Power Buys You Distance From The Crime started out as a much less defensible seed of an idea with a much worse explanation. I know that had I talked about it in public it would have caused a bunch of unproductive yelling that made it harder to think because I did and it did (but later, when it was ready, intellectual combat with John Wentworth improved the idea further).The entire genre of “Here’s a cool new emotional tool I’m exploring”The entire genre of “I’m having a feeling about a thing and I don’t know why yet”\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve been on the butterfly crushing end of this myself- I’m thinking of a particular case last year where my friend brought up an idea that, if true, would require costly action on my part. I started arguing with the idea, they snapped at me to stop ruining their dreams. I chilled out, we had a long discussion about their goals, how they interpreted some evidence, and why they thought a particular action might further said goals, etc.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nA week later all of my objections to the specific idea were substantiated and we agreed not to do the thing- but thanks to the conversation we had in the meantime, I have a better understanding of them and what kinds of things would be appealing to them in the future. That was really valuable to me and I wouldn’t have learned all that if I’d crushed the butterfly in the beginning.\\n\\n\\n\\nNotably, checking out that idea was fairly expensive, and only worth it because this was an extremely close friend (which both made the knowledge of them more valuable, and increased the payoff to helping them if they’d been right). If they had been any less close, I would have said “good luck with that” and gone about my day, and that would have been a perfectly virtuous reaction.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nI almost never discuss butterfly ideas on the public internet, or even 1:many channels. Even when people don’t actively antagonize them, the environment of Facebook or even large group chats means that people often read with half their brain and respond to a simplified version of what I said. For a class of ideas that live and die by context and nuance and pre-verbal intuitions, this is crushing. So what I write in public ends up being on the very defensible end of the things I think. This is a little bit of a shame, because the returns to finding new friends to study your particular butterflies with is so high, but ce la vie.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThis can play out a few ways in practice. Sometimes someone will say “this is a butterfly idea” before they start talking. Sometimes when someone is being inappropriately aggressive towards an idea the other person will snap “will you please stop crushing my butterflies!” and the other will get it. Sometimes someone will overstep, read the other’s facial expression, and say “oh, that was a butterfly, wasn’t it?”. All of these are marked improvements over what came before, and have led to more productive discussions with less emotional pain on both sides.',\n",

The hope is to route a smart entity\\'s performance through a dumb entity\\'s understanding and thereby get the smart entity to solve interpretability-by-the-dumb-entity. While my proposed current architecture overcomes a class of counterexamples in a manner which I find elegant, it is still broken by several plausible counterexamples.\\xa0A previous version of this post linked to a Google doc.\\xa0Previously, on ELKThis section summarizes ELK. Skip if you’re already familiar.In the mythos of\\xa0Eliciting Latent Knowledge, there exists a forbidden vault locking away an enormous diamond:In order to fend off thieves, this vault brims with controllable traps and tricks. We\\'ve trained a really smart AI to take in a video feed, and consider an action sequence (e.g. \"open the trapdoor\"), and then predict what the vault camera will show if those actions are taken. At the end of the day, we just want to know whether the diamond is safe. Looking at the camera is not always enough:But the AI is really smart. It knows what happened to the diamond. Can we elicit its latent knowledge?The original ELK document tries to figure out how to train a \"reporter\" to figure out what\\'s going on in a really smart AI predictor. The intended reporter would\\xa0directly translate\\xa0from the AI\\'s ontology to the human’s ontology, and then answer whether the diamond is there or not. In the original ELK document, the reporter is wired as follows:The training questions/answers are generated by a human considering a range of simple, human-comprehensible situations (i.e. (video, action sequence) tuples), querying their model of what happened, and answering e.g. whether the diamond is safe or not:We never want there to be a situation where the AI predictor (the \"figure out what\\'s going on\" module)\\xa0unambiguously knows that the diamond was taken, but the reporter says \"the diamond is fine.\" More precisely, we don\\'t want such a configuration to plausibly minimize training loss.\\xa0The direct translator minimizes training loss because it answers all questions correctly on the training distribution. So far, so good. However, the\\xa0human simulator\\xa0reporter also minimizes training loss, by extracting the predicted video completion from the AI predictor, and then conditioning the human labeler on the entire video and action sequence, and then outputting whatever the human would think about the situation. On the training distribution, this setup gets all of the questions right (and so minimizes training loss), because it exactly reproduces the labeling process! But in general, the human won\\'t understand many situations, and so the human simulator will output answers which the AI predictor knows to be incorrect.The direct translator solves ELK for narrowly defined questions (e.g. \"is the diamond still in the room?\"). How do we get it?Thinking Via A Human ImitatorI want to structure the problem so that direct translation is instrumentally required for minimizing predictive training loss. To that end: What if the AI had to do some proportion\\xa0p\\xa0of its thinking in the human net?Assume that both the AI and the human reason using Bayes nets.[1]\\xa0Suppose we have access to a perfect simulation[2]\\xa0of not only a human Bayes net, but of the human who labels the training data.\\xa0The AI receives the first part of a video and a sequence of actions. Suppose the AI can think for\\xa0n\\xa0time steps in total, before it has to predict the remainder of the video. At timestep\\xa0(1−p)n/2, the AI encodes its cognitive work into the human imitator net, where the human’s inference algorithm runs for another\\xa0pn\\xa0steps. Lastly, the AI decodes the human’s state of mind and thinks for the remaining time.\\xa0For example: If\\xa0p=⅓, then the AI thinks for\\xa0n/3\\xa0steps, the human thinks for\\xa0n/3\\xa0steps, and then the AI thinks for\\xa0n/3\\xa0steps.\\xa0In order to answer questions, after the last time step, the encoder maps the predictor net’s internal state onto the human net, where the reporter then answers questions. This is illustrated in the diagram below.The human imitator net is frozen. Everything else is learned concurrently. The “AI predictor”, “encoder”, and “human imitator” modules are the same entities, shown duplicated in order to clarify the computational graph of a forward pass.Training procedureWe initialize the agent architecture displayed in the diagram, freezing the human imitator network.Given a dataset labeled by the human, jointly train the green components:For each ((video-1, action sequence, video-2), (question, answer)) pair:Provide (video-1, action sequence, question) as input and train the network to predict video-2 and the right answer, handing off inference on the schedule specified above.Desired outcomeThe intended (or “faithful”) encoder finds an extremely good (or even the best) mapping from the AI’s ontology to the human’s.The intended decoder[3]\\xa0efficiently incorporates the human’s cognitive work back into the AI predictor’s cognitive state.The intended reporter mimics the human’s query function.Why the intended network defeats counterexamples. Suppose that at its final step of inference, the predictor believes that the diamond has been stolen. If ELK is possible to solve in this instance, there exists a direct translator which reports this fact via translation into the human ontology, and an AI → human ontology map would exist. The intended encoder implements that map and encodes this fact into the imitated human network. The intended reporter implements the human’s query function and reports that the diamond has been stolen.Therefore, (narrow) ELK reduces to finding the intended encoder and reporter, as described in the bullet points above. Now let’s examine how hard the reduced problem is.Learning the reporterI first want to argue that if the intended encoder is assumed to have been learned, we also learn the intended reporter.[4]\\xa0To understand what reporters will be incentivized, let’s reconsider the causal history of the human-provided labels:The human query function is just the pink box in the following:That is, the human query function takes in a question, which determines the subset of the net which it considers, and then computes an answer as a function of that subset. For generality, the query function can take different questions as inputs, like “did anyone open the door?”, and then answer by using a different part of the human Bayes net.The human-provided data points necessarily portray situations that the human basically understands. Therefore, since we assumed the encoder is faithful and the predictor is powerful enough to figure out the second half of the video: on each training example, the simulated and real human end up in very similar states of mind after doing inference. Just compare the AI’s diagram with the human’s diagram, in order to see that on the training distribution and given a faithful encoder, the after-AI prediction-finishes human imitator should be reasoning extremely similarly to the human. All that’s left to learn is the human query function! Hopefully, this is a simple “blank” for the AI to fill in.\\xa0For example, suppose the real human knows that the action sequence opens the trapdoor, and that the video shows someone falling into it. Because the predictor understands the situation and we have the intended encoder, the imitated human also knows this, and perhaps they also know some additional translated details. Therefore, to produce the correct answer, the reporter just has to look at the imitated human’s net and pick out the relevant nodes for the real human’s query function. This is the prototypical human-understandable training example.The reporter could instead minimize training loss by learning another human simulator which independently does inference after backing out (video-1, action sequence, video-2) from the imitated human net, but without having the second human simulator’s intermediate nodes filled in by the encoder. But assuming a faithful encoder, that seems rather ridiculous and easily handled via time or complexity regularization.[5]I think there may be a strong story for why a faithful encoder ensures that the learned reporter will be faithful. Contrast this situation to that in the ELK report, where we’re constantly fighting to stop the reporter from being a human simulator. Here, we’re trying to learn a much simpler reporter. Therefore, I’m more optimistic about asking questions for which only the intended reporter is the answer.Learning the decoderI’m not worried about the decoder, except insofar as it encourages or discourages faithful encoders. Given the intended encoder, a competent decoder is learned to reduce predictive loss.Learning the encoderFiguring out how to learn the intended encoder would be a big deal. We would know how to force arbitrarily smart agents to solve interpretability on themselves as an instrumental subgoal for their prediction task.\\xa0Candidate counterexamplesHere are a range of attempted counterexamples. First, I claim that training_loss(intended setup) < training_loss(naive human simulator).Candidate counterexample: Suppose the encoder reads (video-1, actions, predicted video-2) from the AI predictor module, and then simulates the human overseer doing inference from those observations, and then somehow forces the human imitator net to believe what the human would believe about the diamond, after reasoning from those inputs. Tautologically, this minimizes training loss for the questions.\\xa0Rebuttal: This reduces the predictive accuracy of the whole AI system, since\\xa0pn\\xa0of the AI’s total inference time is wasted.[6]\\xa0The intended network leverages at least some useful computation by the human to improve the AI’s predictions, while also acing all of the questions on the training distribution (assuming zero labeling error).\\xa0\\xa0Candidate counterexample: The AI predictor wipes its internal state at the last moment, except for its intended prediction.\\xa0Rebuttal: This can’t minimize loss, since the AI predicts slightly less well than an AI which spent all of its available time thinking.\\xa0Candidate counterexample: The encoder implements a meaningful translation midway through the computation, but checks to see if the AI predictor is done thinking, and if so, simulates a human instead.\\xa0Rebuttal: Randomly select both\\xa0p\\xa0and the time when the AI predictor must hand off thinking to the human net. This way, the encoder shouldn’t be able to distinguish between encoding-to-think and encoding-to-report.\\xa0Candidate counterexample: For each training data point, the encoder runs a human simulator, sets the human’s initial beliefs to correctly answer the question if immediately queried by the reporter, but without faithfully encoding the AI’s understanding into the human’s beliefs. Then, if the human net keeps thinking, that means the reporter isn’t being called, and somehow the human’s beliefs evolve in a way which will help the AI predictor once the human’s final beliefs are decoded, without those beliefs meaningfully corresponding to the real situation.\\xa0Rebuttal: During training, run the human net for\\xa0pn\\xa0steps before calling the reporter. Given that we also randomize\\xa0p, this incentivizes the encoder to ensure the human net answers correctly—even if the human net thinks for varying amounts of time before the reporter is called.[7]\\xa0(Therefore, during deployment, the reporter can query the human net immediately.)The above counterexample attempts suggest that during training, we should eliminate observable differences between encoding-to-think and encoding-to-report. Therefore, I think we should modify the simplified hand-off procedure I described above so that, during training:A range of handoff thresholds and\\xa0p\\xa0proportions are drawn—in particular, there should be a reasonable probability of drawing\\xa0p\\xa0values close to 0, close to 1, and also 0 and 1 exactly.The human net runs for\\xa0pn\\xa0steps before calling the reporter.Candidate counterexample (h/t janus):\\xa0The encoder implements:\\xa0IF human can understand the situation without direct translation:                     \\t\\n\\ttranslate accurately\\nELSE: \\n\\tdon\\'tRebuttal:\\xa0This encoder essentially checks whether it’s on the training distribution or not, since we assume we only train on human-comprehensible situations. This encoder seems like an implausible thing to learn, but perhaps it’s considered a plausible counterexample in the ELK game.\\xa0\\xa0Definite counterexample (h/t Evan Hubinger):\\xa0Instead of directly translating the state of the room to the human net, an unfaithful encoder computes what imaginary additional cameras would show, given the AI’s best understanding. This unfaithful encoder basically communicates a telepathic vision to the human net, via several simulated video feeds. In fact, the encoder is truthful about what the sensors would show, if they were there. On the training distribution, the rendered videos give the human net an accurate picture of the AI’s best situational understanding. Therefore, the human compute time should be about as predictively helpful as the direct translator’s compute time.\\xa0However, there exist situations off of training distribution where the imaginary sensors are fooled, and so ELK generalization fails. In such cases, the AI predictor knows that there\\'s no diamond, but the unfaithful encoder doesn\\'t communicate that.Analysis: I think that there should be some way besides direct translation to better leverage the human net’s compute, and this seems like a plausible grounding of how it might happen. Unless this is somehow ruled out, I think this counts as a counterexample: There will be situations not in the training distribution, in which the AI predictor knows that the diamond is missing, but where the imaginary sensors are being fooled. However, this bad encoder does not tell the human that the diamond is missing, and so the reporter wrongly answers that the diamond is still present.Here are some issues I want more clarity on:\\xa0Perhaps it’s better for the encoder to unfaithfully translate so as to help the human net better consume compute, so as to better help the AI predictor use the human net’s inference time.\\xa0The unfaithful encoding has to pass the questions on the training distribution, which seems to require a bad/non-intended reporter.If we already have an unfaithful encoder, the intended reporter may get questions wrong, which might encourage the reporter to be a human simulator (even overcoming regularization).\\xa0Since the encoder is bad, the reporter is bad; since the reporter is bad, the encoder stays bad. Is this a plausible local minimum?This also requires learning a bad encoder to begin with.The costs of direct translation probably grow with the sophistication of the AI predictor, but the costs of human simulation are fixed. Therefore, it might be a better use of the encoder’s compute to simulate the human, fix the right answers in the human net, while also using most of its encoder-compute to keep making progress on the prediction task. The encoder’s work would be stored in the rest of the human net’s nodes, which serves as a latent space for the decoder. (h/t Leo Gao)Note that as\\xa0n→∞, there\\'s increasing benefit to using the frozen human net.The AI predictor might only translate human-comprehensible aspects of the situation, factoring the cognitive work so that the human net thinks about the parts of the situation for which they have a comparative advantage.\\xa0\\xa0Note that the training distribution only contains human-comprehensible situations.\\xa0Also, the human net might make bad inferences sometimes.If it’s due to systemic bias, the decoder could simply adjust the human net’s outputs when incorporating their conclusions back into the predictor net. This means that the encoder can still be faithful.However, the human net may need to be “lied to” by the encoder in a way which is not just simplification via direct translation, but encoding-level distortion so that the human’s decoded cognitive work is more helpful for prediction.We might mitigate this by doing perfect inference in the human net.\\xa0But this would make the approach less likely to transfer when the human cognition isn’t neatly represented in a Bayesian network.Depending on how we balance loss between prediction and question-answering, and the expressiveness of the AI network, loss-minimizing configurations may be chosen from a nontrivial Pareto frontier of (total predictive loss, total Q/A loss), which might change the analysis.Does the scheme definitely break if the simulated human is stupid (e.g. –2SD intelligence)? If so, that’s a bad sign, as it’s unlikely that the approach just\\xa0happens\\xa0to start robustly working somewhere in between stupid and smart human intelligence levels.CompetitivenessI think that this setup allows predictive accuracy which is competitive with the unaligned benchmark—even more so once training is over.Training distribution. At worst, the AI can just ignore the decoder output, and so the AI isn’t any worse at prediction than if it only had\\xa01−p\\xa0times its original thinking time.\\xa0Deployment. After training is complete, we don’t actually have to make the AI consult the human net at all; we can set\\xa0p=0. This should work fine if we train the network with a range of\\xa0p\\xa0values and handoff thresholds, so that it’s used to reasoning on its own, to reasoning mostly via the human, to everywhere in between; at any time, the encoder should be ready to read out the predictor module’s state to the human.\\xa0While the AI might be used to “working with” the human net, the predictor presumably consumes compute more efficiently than does the encoder/human net/decoder ensemble, and so the runtime compute budget is likely best used by the AI predictor. Once the predictor has finished inference, we can just encode the final state into the human net, where the reporter answers questions about the situation.One way in which the intended network could suffer a performance penalty is, the AI predictor learns to make its cognition more easily human-interpretable (so as to make the encoding/decoding easier), which somewhat restricts its predictive capabilities. This issue is not fixed by setting\\xa0p=0\\xa0at runtime. I’m not sure how big of a deal this is.ConclusionI feel excited about this proposal. It seems to at least defeat the naive human simulator in an interesting way, but e.g. Evan’s counterexample shows that it still fails in the worst case. That is, there are many ways to extract useful compute from the human net, and we already know of one which is not direct translation. I probably need a significantly better design to exclude all of the ways which are not direct translation—if that’s even possible at all. I think it’s very probable (90%) that a simple counterexample-free design simply doesn’t exist.I wonder whether there are basic design improvements which cleanly resolve many of the remaining issues.\\xa0Thanks to AI_WAIFU, janus, Evan Hubinger, Mark Xu, Leo Gao, Justis Mills, and Rohin Shah for feedback.^This proposal only seems to require that both agents reason in a way where “amount of time thinking” is a sensible parameter.^Perfect imitation is a simplifying assumption which may not be realistic, but whose presence does not make ELK obviously trivial. I think that if this approach works given the assumption, we can probably relax it.^The decoder affects the AI’s predictive capabilities during training; it is logically unrelated to whether the system solves ELK, or to its capabilities during deployment. Practically, absent a good decoder, there is little reason for a faithful encoder to be learned.^Even if this holds, however, we will still have to reason about whether the two components can be jointly learned, or if the intended encoder can be learned before the reporter. Let’s set that aside for now.^We avoid the pitfalls of regularizing the ELK-reporter because our intended reporter doesn’t have to translate from the superhuman predictor, it just has to deal with the constant-size frozen human imitator network.^This logic fails if the AI predictor can get pixel-perfect video prediction on the training distribution, even without using the human’s portion of the time budget. However, this is presumably dealt with by having some chance of p being close to 1—so that the human net has to do most of the information processing.^This probably rules out a class of “fragile” encodings which don’t make sense upon human reflection, which might push towards more faithful and robust encoders.',\n",

       " {'text': 'IntroductionI am a very anxious person. One of the most damaging ways this manifests is that I am pretty risk-averse and afraid of failure. In situations of uncertainty, I often want to freeze up, and know I’ll feel safer doing nothing. This is a really bad problem! If I let this dictate my life, I lose a ton of value. In particular, there are a lot of areas in my life that are hits-based, where the best way to be successful is to persevere through many failures and seek the upside risk of things occasionally going super well. I want to be someone who can be a great researcher, find really awesome friends, and generally be ambitious about all areas of my life going well. And to achieve this, it is important that I be the kind of person who can take actions with high expected value, and persevere through failures without feeling paralysed. The key thing going wrong here is that I beat myself up over bad outcomes even when I had no way of knowing it wouldn’t work out, given the information at the time. And anxiety gives me a negative prior and causes suboptimal outcomes to stick in my mind. Failures feel painful in a way that missed opportunities do not.My solution to this is to think in bets, not outcomes. To clearly notice all of the good bets that I take, the actions that I endorse given what I knew at the time, and to be happy about each of those. And to think of my life in terms of this, rather than the concrete outcomes of the bet, and whether that was a success or failure. At the end of the day, the only thing I can control is the bets that I make, and the policies I follow, and there will always be uncertainty on the outcomes. And if I make a good bet with a bad outcome, I should be happy about this, not sad! I refuse to let my negative emotions be tied to things fundamentally outside my control.My Underlying ModelI first formed this view when I did a trading internship a few years ago. In settings like financial trading or poker, the fundamental skill is about engaging well with uncertainty, and getting past anxieties is a key part of that! And noticing all of the expected value I was missing when I froze up did a lot for helping me notice this failure mode and learning how to solve it. And though the lessons generalise, real life is often a much harder learning environment than these settings - I make fewer bets and so get fewer data points, and it’s much harder to explicitly calculate what’s going on.I find it easiest to understand what’s going on here and how to fix it when thinking of myself as having a reinforcement learning system inside my head, shaping my actions. I take actions in the world, get feedback from my environment, and use this to update the policies that I follow. Within this framing, there are two clear problems with learning to make good bets with high upside, while being anxious.The first problem arises because reality is noisy! Even if I had zero anxiety, fundamentally reality has unknowns and I must make decisions under uncertainty. But, by default, I only learn about my actions from their outcomes. And this makes it really hard to learn strategies around pursuing occasional major upsides! It’s obviously worth it to go on 99 unsuccessful dates if the hundredth results in marriage. But by default, my reinforcement learner will likely be discouraged and stop after 99 failures. While, if I can reframe it as 99 successful bets, then I get much better!The second problem comes from anxiety, which causes me to over-update on negative feedback, and consider it way more important than positives. This is a fundamental issue with my learning algorithm that means I will learn systematically bad policies. By focusing on the action I took being good, this reduces the anxiety caused by unsuccessful outcomes. Note that negative feedback doesn’t just include stuff that may actually be a big deal, like a romantic rejection, or missing out on a job I really cared about. At least for me, my anxiety reacts badly to even minor negative outcomes with no real consequences, like making a joke that didn’t land, or recommending a book to someone that they’ve already read.By default, I feel like I can solve these issues if I just try harder. Think harder about an issue, go through every consideration, analyse it more deeply, and only take the actions that will work out well. This is an illusion! Reality is not fully knowable. And thinking harder has costs. If I follow the strategy of “just try harder”, I will implicitly miss a lot of bets worth taking. The optimal strategy, given that I am an imperfect person in an uncertain world, is to take positive expected value bets. Finding ways to learn well in spite of anxiety is essential, because anxiety holds me back from so many bets worth taking.How to Apply This?The idea of thinking of my actions as bets and not focusing on their outcomes is a pretty core part of how I think about my life, and is useful in a wide range of areas in different ways. A quick brainstorm of different areas where my anxiety significantly holds me back from making the right bets:Applying for jobsAsking people out/going on datesPursuing research directionsMaking friends, and generally taking social initiativeOffering people help and favoursRecommending books/articles/resourcesIntroducing people who might get onWriting a blog postOr starting a blog in the first place!Writing a cold emailGiving adviceAsking for helpEspecially asking someone for their time, or anything else with a risk of rejection and that might be being a burden!Any form of seeking upside riskSharing opportunities - I personally try hard to message people with jobs that might be a good fit, good articles I read they might enjoy, etc.The instance of this I’m most proud of is getting stressed about Omicron near the start of the surge, and messaging 100 friends with instructions on how to get boosters earlier - this felt stressful at the time, but resulted in 5-10 counterfactually getting it a week or two earlier, and 1-3 getting a booster at all.Exercise: Set a 5 minute timer and brainstorm times in your life when this bias applies. How could you orient to these in terms of bets, not outcomes? The exact way I try to think in bets not outcomes varies depending on context, but there are a few core principles that stand out:Find ways to actively be excited about unsuccessful outcomes, so long as I think it was a good bet!One way that works well for me is to reflect on how the action fits my self-identity, and is an example of becoming the kind of person I want to be. This successfully shifts focus from outcomes because my identity is a function of the actions I take, not the feedback from the worldThis is the core insight of becoming a person who actually does thingsAnother way is to quantify thingsMake a log of your unsuccessful bets, eg a list of rejections or failures. Set targets for how many failures you want to have, and see each one as an example of becoming someone who can put yourself out there!Estimate the probability of the outcome you want! Eg Chris Olah’s framing of dating and meeting potential partners in terms of micro-marriagesMagnify your excitement about positive outcomes! Remember them, cherish them, and use them as motivation!Keep a log of great outcomes, and bets going well.Eg, I often share opportunities in group chats, and know of at least two people who’ve gotten internships this way - I find this super motivating to do it more often!Relatedly, I keep a log of particularly happy memories and meaningful compliments, which is really uplifting to read when I’m downNotice selection bias - all the good outcomes you might not hear about! Eg, I occasionally hear from people who’ve had significant life improvements from things I’ve done. This is fucking awesome in and of itself, but even better when I reflect on how I likely miss out on most things like this!Try to shift the selection bias, by making it clear that you love hearing about things like this, and being easy to reach!If anything I’ve done has improved your life, I’d love to hear about it!Reflect on whether I could have done something differently, given what I knew at the time. This really helps to defuse the anxiety that I’m missing an important lesson and could have known better, and occasionally get the insight that it was a bad outcome!It’s important to focus on given what I knew at the time. If I’m not careful, my anxieties love to smuggle in some hindsight bias, and tell me that I’m an idiot for not having known the future! By focusing on general policies I could follow, I can get past this.Engage my inner simulator and ask myself “Suppose, at the time, I predicted it would go badly and decided not to do it. Am I surprised by this outcome?”Further, ask myself what happened, and why I decided not to do it. Was it for the right reasons?Take the outside view - is there any similar past action that did go well? And if so, was this case obviously worse than that one, given what I knew beforehand back then? Can I find a policy which avoided this failure without missing out on that success?Does This Reward Bad Bets Too?One caveat worth addressing is whether this strategy could be dangerous? When I think about putting it into practice, this is the biggest flinch from my anxiety - maybe my bets are actually systematically bad and I am deluding myself, and the outcomes are the only way to get this feedback. This is obviously worth considering, and will sometimes happen! The ideal world is one where I evaluate each outcome for information that I’m missing, and take it as a slight negative update on whether the bet was worth making. But there is no way of reaching that ideal world - my anxiety is a major bias, it pushes me towards risk-aversion, and it’s basically impossible to perfectly correct for a bias like this. My solution essentially introduces a counter-bias, towards ignoring the outcomes by default, which pushes me towards risk-seeking. In principle, there’s some risk of overshooting the ideal point and being too risk-seeking, but in practice I think this is really unlikely! Especially if I explicitly reflect on whether I could have known better. My anxiety creates a pretty big bias towards risk-aversion, and dealing with anxiety is hard, and nothing I do is likely to create as big a bias the other way. I’m not able to ignore the anxiety at particularly bad outcomes, or the creeping doubt of getting way more unsuccessful outcomes than expected. The sheer fact that I feel anxiety about overshooting is a sign that I am safe, and can trust myself to not go too far without needing to actively track it!Rewarding Other People’s BetsMany of my anxieties are social in nature, and I get way more anxious about bad outcomes involving other people. And it’s much easier for someone else to help me overcome a socially-related anxiety by giving reliable feedback, than trying to deal with it within the insecurities of my own head. I like to seek positive externalities, so a great (and sad) thing is that this works in reverse - social anxieties are super common, so if I can help other people reward themselves for good bets with bad outcomes, I can help them make much better bets! Often I do this by being enthusiastic and positive when I see someone who made a good bet with a bad outcome - offering them sympathies about the outcome itself of course, but also congratulating them on putting themselves out there, and making a good bet! I think it’s reasonable to have some concern about insincerity or seeming mocking/insensitive, but in practice I find this often goes down well. Especially if I explain the framing of bets not outcomes, and get them to think about whether the bet was a bad idea given what they knew at the time.This applies in all the settings I brainstormed above, but is particularly important if someone made a good bet towards me! Eg someone recommends I apply for a job that’s a bad fit, sends me an article I didn’t enjoy, a book recommendation I’ve already read, an introduction that didn’t work out, gave me advice I’d already tried or that didn’t work, etc. I know I find it super discouraging to be on the other end of that, so I always try to clearly say that what they did was positive expected value, and that I appreciate it and hope they do that kind of thing again! A lot of great things in my life have come from people sending me good opportunities, and it’s crazy to train people to not do that. (Though only if I think it actually was positive expected value, obviously - don’t reward people for bad bets and bad outcomes!)Doing this also selfishly helps me - it creates a social context around me where other people will reward me for taking good bets, and helps build the association in my mind that eg ‘applying for jobs and getting rejected = good’, which helps me internalise it and apply this to myself.Exercise: Set a 5 minute timer and brainstorm ways you can help reward people around you for making good bets with bad outcomes.ConclusionIf you relate with the failure mode of fixating on failures and being risk-averse, I think it’s really worth trying to be on top of this, and focusing instead on the actions you took, given what you knew at the time! Anecdotally this seems super common - many of the smartest people I know are super insecure and risk averse. And this is a massive tragedy because the world is full of wasted motion - if you’re unable to be ambitious and take the opportunities that come your way, you’ll miss out on a lot.So, as a final exercise, reflect on where this bias holds you back in your own life. What are the good bets you fail to make? What opportunities do you miss out on? Where do your anxieties unduly punish you? And what are you going to do about it?',\n",

       " {'text': 'Epistemic status:\\xa0exploratoryWhat is “intuition pumping”? I had seen the term used on LW, probably used it myself, without wondering that much what “intuition pumps” even are. Pure pedagogical illustrations? Mere rhetorical devices? Subtle epistemic tools? My intuition about intuitions favored the latter, but I also knew well how intuition can mislead.To make sense of all of this, I went back to the source, the inventor and master wielder of intuition pumps: Daniel Dennett. Not only did he coin the term and use it abundantly, but his “Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking” teaches how to use intuition pumps\\xa0his way.Spoiler alert: they can and should be used as thinking tools to find out the essential parts of the problem. But that requires a meta-level analysis that Dennett calls “turning the knobs”— checking the robustness of the intuition to various changes in the story.Intuition pumps’ origin storyEveryone I’ve read on intuition pumps, Dennett included, points to his response to Searle’s\\xa0Chinese Room as the birth of the term.(The milk of human intentionality, Dennett, 1980)Searle\\'s form of argument is a familiar one to philosophers: he has constructed what one might call an intuition pump, a device for provoking a family of intuitions by producing variations on a basic thought experiment. An intuition pump is not, typically, an engine of discovery, but a persuader or pedagogical tool — a way of getting people to see things\\xa0your way once you\\'ve seen the truth, as Searle thinks he has. I would be the last to disparage the use of intuition pumps — I love to use them myself — but they can be abused. In this instance I think Searle relies almost entirely on ill-gotten gains: favorable intuitions generated by misleadingly presented thought experiments.What’s interesting here is that Dennett seems to have expanded his views on the usefulness of intuition pumps: here he explicitly criticizes the use of intuition pumps for discovery and clarification, but in Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking he clearly count them as thinking tools that have positive and research-relevant uses. He also gives a bit more of a definition there.\\xa0(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)Other thought experiments are less rigorous but often just as effective: little stories designed to provoke a heartfelt, table-thumping intuition —”Yes, of course, it has to be so!”— about whatever thesis is being defended. I have called these intuition pumps. I coined the term in the first of my public critiques of philosopher John Searle’s famous\\xa0Chinese Room thought experiment, and some thinkers concluded I meant the term to be disparaging or dismissive. On the contrary, I love intuition pumps! That is, some intuition pumps are excellent, some are dubious, and only a few are downright deceptive.One last point on origins, before I dig into the uses of intuition pumps: Dennett clearly says that he didn’t invent intuition pumps, he just coined the term. He actually sees them as the core and legacy of philosophy since the beginning (Plato’s Cave is one of his examples)(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)These are the enduring melodies of philosophy, with the staying power that ensures that students will remember them, quite vividly and accurately, years after they have forgotten the intricate surrounding arguments and analysis. A good intuition pump is more robust than any one version of it.Choosing what to focus onI can’t find the quote I have in mind, but Dennett clearly describes intuition pumps at multiple points as tools for simplification of problems. They gloss over the technical details and the subtleties, homing in on some part of the question.Yet how do we know these are the relevant parts? In principle nothing forbids us to choose any aspect of the question and discard everything else. That’s what Dennett means when reminding us to be careful with intuition pumps: they don’t have to pump the correct intuitions.Still, even when the choice of details is wrong, it can teach us something.(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)Notice that there are two ways an intuition pump may prove valuable. If it’s well made, then either the intuition it pumps are reliable and convincing, in which case it nicely blocks some otherwise tempting path of error, or the intuitions still seem dubious, in which case the intuition pump may help focus attention on what is wrong with its own presuppositions.To summarize:If the simplification actually works and focus on (at least some) relevant details, the intuition pump redirect our thoughts away from the confusion coming from irrelevant detailsIf the simplification doesn’t work, then we get some feedback on which details are missing or more relevant by examining how the intuition pump fails.I see an additional subtlety: Dennett distinguishes well-made intuition pumps that focus on the wrong parts, and badly-made intuition pumps. And my impression is that he proposes ways of verifying “well-madeness”, not so much which parts to focus on. I want to discuss that after presenting Dennett’s main way of checking the structural integrity of an intuition pump: turning the knobs.Robustness to knob turningThe tool Dennett leverages for checking intuition pumps is called “turning the knobs”, following Hofstader.(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)When Doug Hofstader and I composed\\xa0The Mind’s I back in 1982, he came up with just the right advice on this score: consider the intuition pump to be a tool with many settings, and “turn all the knobs” to see if the same intuitions still get pumped when you consider variations.By this he means changing elements of the story in many different ways, to see whether the intuition stays the same, or shifts with the changes. The claim here is that a good intuition pump (in the sense of well-made) should not be too sensitive to changes that look irrelevant.Searle’s Chinese Room is Dennett’s favorite example of oversensitivity to turning the knobs. In “Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking”, Dennett focuses on turning the knob about the level of description of the whole system: if you look at the system as a whole, not just the man in the room, and think about what is needed in term of computation to hold a conversation in Chinese, then it’s not obvious anymore that the whole system doesn’t \"understand\" Chinese.(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)Look at what we’ve just done. We’ve turned the knob on Searle’s intuition pump that controls the level of description of the program being followed. There are always many levels. At the highest level, the comprehending powers of the system are not unimaginable; we even get insights into just how the system comes to understand what it does. The system’s reply no longer looks embarrassing; it looks obviously correct. That doesn’t mean that AI of the sort Searle was criticizing actually achieves a level of competence worth calling understanding, nor that those methods, extended in the ways then imagined by those AI researchers, would likely have led to such high competences, but just that Searle’s thought experiment doesn’t succeed in what it claims to accomplish: demonstrating the flat-out impossibility of Strong AI.There are other knobs to turn, but that task has been carried out extensively in the huge literature the Chinese Room has provoked. Here I am concentrating on the thinking tool itself, not the theories and propositions it was aimed at, and showing that it is a defective tool: it persuades by clouding our imagination, not exploiting it well.In the Mind’s I, Hofstader and Dennett describe at least five knobs for the Chinese Room (what sort of matter is the system made of, what is the accuracy of the computation, what is the size of the system, what sort of being is inside the room, and how fast the being can work), and argue that turning them independently lead to variations in the pumped intuitions.\\xa0(The Mind’s I, Dennett and Hofstader, 1981)Each setting of the dials on our intuition pump yields a slightly different narrative, with different problems receding into the background and different morals drawn. Which version or versions should be trusted is a matter to settle by examining them carefully, to see which features of the narrative are doing the work. If the oversimplifications are the source of the intuitions, rather than just devices for suppressing irrelevant complications, we should mistrust the conclusions we are invited to draw. These are matters of delicate judgment, so it is no wonder that a generalized and quite justified suspicion surrounds such exercises of imagination and speculation.Why is sensitivity to turning the knobs so bad? As Dennett and Hofstader write above, if the intuition depends so much on the details, then it probably means it’s created by the details to a large extent. So it’s evidence of a made intuition instead of a revealed intuition. Every intuition is pumped and made to some extent, but we prefer when the bias depends on actual bits of evidence.The way my theoretical computer scientist’s brain thinks about it is through\\xa0smoothed analysis. Without getting into the weeds, smoothed analysis is a form of complexity analysis (time complexity for example) which discards\\xa0isolated costly inputs. Isolated means that whenever you change even a little the input, its cost drops completely. The intuition for not considering those inputs is that you need perfect (often infinite) precision to get them, and any noise in the input will actually remove the costly part.The analogy I see here is with the robustness to change: Dennett wants to discard the intuitions pumped only in isolated or quasi-isolated cases. Or at the very least he’s particularly suspicious of such intuition pumps, because they don’t seem to capture the underlying structure well.To close this section, it’s hard to resist including this witty footnote of Dennett on this exact point(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)Doug zeroed in on the phrase “bits of paper” in Searle’s essay, and showed how it encouraged people to underestimate the size and complexity of the software involved by many orders of magnitude. His commentary on Searle in our book featured this criticism, and led to a ferocious response from Searle (1982) in the pages of the\\xa0New York Review of Books, because, although we had reprinted his article correctly, in his commentary Doug slipped and wrote “a few slips” where Searle had said “bits,” and this, Searle claimed, completely misrepresented his argument! If Searle is right about this, if that small inadvertent mutation transformed the machinery, this actually proved our point, in a way: if such a tiny adjustment disables or enables a thought experiment, that is something that should be drawn to the attention of all whose intuitions are up for pumping.What to do with a robust intuition pump?Let’s assume that we have a decently robust intuition pump; what next? Here I find Dennett harder to follow, not necessarily because he doesn’t have an answer but because the lack of some core idea as clarifying as turning the knob.The easiest case is probably when the intuition pump works for almost all settings of the knobs. In such a situation, it sounds reasonable to consider the intuition as good and use the pump to avoid errors and mistakes.One such example is “Daddy’s a doctor”(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)A young child is asked what her father does, and she answers, “Daddy is a doctor.” Does she believe what she says? In one sense, of course, but what would she have to know to\\xa0really believe it? (What if she’d said, “Daddy is an arbitrager” or “Daddy is an actuary”?) Suppose we suspected that she was speaking without understanding, and decided to test her. Must she be able to produce paraphrases or to expand on her claim by saying her father cures sick people? Is it enough if she knows that Daddy’s being a doctor precludes his being a butcher, a baker, a candlestick maker? Does she know what a doctor is if she lacks the concept of a fake doctor, a quack, an unlicensed practitioner? For that matter, how much does she need to understand to know that Daddy is her father? (Her adoptive father? Her “biological” father?) Clearly her understanding of what it is to be a doctor, as well of what it is to be a father, will grow over the years, and hence her understanding of he own sentence, “Daddy is a doctor,” will grow. Can we specify — in a nonarbitrary way — how much she must know in order to understand this proposition “completely”?The intuition pumped here is that understanding, and thus belief, come in degree (in part due to logical non-omniscience). I find that strongly intuitive, but more relevant is the great robustness of this story. It doesn’t have to be about “doctor” (Dennett himself switches to “father” in the middle), it doesn’t have to be a child (just someone who still can learn something about the topic at hand, which includes almost everyone if the topic is chosen accordingly). And indeed, I expect that breaking the intuition requires isolated cases like choosing a person who knows everything (literally everything) about topic A.What happens when it’s not as clear cut?One way to think about it is the relative area of different intuitions (in the space of knob parameters). If two or more contradictory intuitions share the space in comparably sized chunks, that means it’s possible to pump contradictory intuitions with well-made pumps.My impression is that Dennett thinks that such instances are ones where intuition pumps shouldn’t be used as arguments. When he criticizes a fallacious intuition pump, he either argues it’s not robust (like the Chinese Room) or that it’s possible to robustly pump the opposite intuition. His arguments against philosophical zombies and the Hard Problem of consciousness are in this latter category.And yet Dennett is rarely content to cancel an intuition pump with another — he usually believes one of those intuitions is a mistake. One argument he uses is the lack of explanation power.(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)I cannot prove that there is no Hard Problem, and Chalmers can’t prove that there is one. He has one potent intuition going for him, and if it generated some striking new predictions, or promised to explain something otherwise baffling, we might join him in trying to construct a new theory of consciousness around it, but it stands alone, hard to deny but otherwise theoretically inert.Basically, if a robustly pumped intuition leads nowhere, then be wary of it.In any case though, I expect Dennett to say that even a problematic intuition pump can teach us things. It can teach us how not to think, and what mistakes we risk falling for.There’s one sort of intuition pump he doesn’t have any use for, though.Nonsense intuition pumpsDennett has no time for intuition pumps that completely break the laws of physics or biology.(Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking, Dennett, 2013)But there is also a deeper problem with such experiments. It is child’s play to dream up examples to “prove” further conceptual points. Suppose a cow gave birth to something that was atom-for-atom indiscernible from a shark. Would it be a shark? If you posed that question to a biologist, the charitable reaction would be that you were making a labored attempt at a joke. Or suppose an evil demon could make water turn solid at room temperature by smiling at it; would the demon-water be ice? This is too silly a hypothesis to deserve a response. Smiling demons, cow-sharks, zombies, and Swampmen are all, some philosophers think, logically possible, even if they are not nomologically (causally) possible, and these philosophers think this is important. I do not.[...]“No,” says the philosopher. “It’s\\xa0not a false dichotomy!\\xa0For the sake of argument\\xa0we’re suspending the laws of physics. Didn’t Galileo do the same when he banished friction from his thought experiments?” Yes, but a general rule of thumb emerges from the comparison: the utility of a thought experiment is inversely proportional to the size of its departures from reality.Just like isolated intuition pumps, these wildly non-causal one look like they’re missing the actual important stuff, and so shouldn’t be thought of as arguments. But Dennett sounds like he considers the intuition pumped there as just noise.ConclusionDennett’s view on intuition is the only one I know that contains both productive models and tools (turning the knobs) while not falling for the false dichotomy of rejecting or venerating intuition. More than anything, he gives tools for thinking about intuition pumps, tools that still work even if one disagrees about his more object-level points.Still, once the robustness to knob-turning and the relative area of knob parameter space are taken into consideration, I don\\'t feel like I have a perfect grasp on the next step. I expect that this will require me rereading of a bunch of intuition pumps, maybe from other people too.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The convoy has been dispersed. Yet Tyler Cowen was clearly correct that this will be a very important event. The story has barely begun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[Writer’s Note: This post violates some of the usual lines that I set for myself regarding politics, because I do not know how to communicate the situation without doing so, nor does it seem like a situation one can safely ignore. I did my best to keep it to a minimum. As before, I will be staying out of the comments, and ask that related discussions be confined to related posts and conducted to minimize the political component, but I acknowledge that this may not be fully possible in this case and will use discretion.]\\n\\n\\n\\nPreviously in Convoy and Convoy Continued, the puzzle was what was happening and what might happen next in response. Authorities were uncertain what to do. The situation was somewhat out of control. Violence was a distinct possibility, or at least the fear of such violence was informing decisions and rhetoric. There were big disputes over the essential nature of the protest, the protesters, what they wanted and why they were there. As far as I could tell the protests were unpopular but that too was disputed. Every edit seemed like it reflected more information from more sources, but more often that not that only meant increased uncertainty.\\n\\n\\n\\nMost of that is now resolved. The convoy has been broken up by police without incident and with zero violence (or at least, zero violence that didn’t involve police acting like police usually act), only minor threats to permanently confiscate people’s dogs, in exactly the most basic and obvious way. A few people are still hanging around, but they no longer threaten public order. The three leaders have been arrested. When one engages in civil disobedience and makes oneself intentionally obstructing traffic for weeks, one eventually gets arrested and faces the consequences of being briefly in jail and having a record, and perhaps more if one committed more serious crimes and the state can convince a jury of that. That’s how it’s supposed to work. There were less than 200 arrests and they towed less than 50 trucks.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s just one little problem.\\n\\n\\n\\nBefore breaking up the protest, as I noted last time, Prime Minister Trudeau1 invoked the Emergencies Act.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Emergencies Act may have been a little bit about the need to commandeer towing capacity, but we can now be very certain what it was centrally about.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was about money.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn particular, it was about giving the government of Canada the permanent power to freeze, without trial or legal recourse, all the bank accounts and other assets of anyone it decides was ‘directly or indirectly involved’ in an ‘illegal protest.’ In practice this translates to ‘freeze the assets of the families of anyone that power or the government dislikes.’\\n\\n\\n\\nIn particular, this clip makes it very clear that it is intended to include anyone who donated to either of their crowdfunding campaigns. If you give the wrong amount of money to support a protest the Canadian government decides it dislikes, they may well freeze your bank accounts and you will have no recourse even if it was in error. In that clip they also say that they are doing this without the Democratic process in part ‘because an opposition party exists to frustrate any government attempt to pass legislation.’\\n\\n\\n\\nIn pursuit of this, they have tasked not only the banks but a wide variety of payment processors and others who handle money, including those handling cryptocurrency, with spying on their customers to determine which ones participated in activities disapproved of by power or the government, and freezing their accounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nIf one’s accounts are frozen and one is both left without resources and without the ability to transact, it is at best extremely difficult to participate in society. One cannot easily hold a job or raise a family, and buying a tomato may prove tricky.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFamily members having trouble living their lives is being treated not as a bug but as a feature. The sins of the father are to be laid upon the children, it seems.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis extends as noted above to those who provide financial assistance to those engaging in disapproved activities, and that such retaliation will continue to happen after the activities in question cease, so not only is one without one’s money and other assets, and without the ability to spend what one does have, others may reasonably fear that helping you not end up on the street might land them in the same situation.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeanwhile, our systems are moving steadily away from cash or any other way to pay for things if one’s accounts are frozen, including the mortgage or the rent. Ending up losing everything is a real possibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nAgain, this is happening in many cases without anyone ever being charged with any crime. Even when crimes are charged, even if the government gets convictions, the punishment here is orders of magnitude out of line and sets the worst kind of precedent. If such folks are guilty of treason or rebellion or terrorism, then charge them with that and see what a jury has to say.\\n\\n\\n\\nAs for those who vote against this policy, here’s what Justin Trudeau has to say, notice what things he totally does not sound like at all, no sir (video is at the link, 38sec).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreedom to Transact\\n\\n\\n\\nWithout the freedom to transact there is no freedom.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is the reality that Canada, and perhaps soon the rest of the world, now faces.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis thread is long (thread unroller version here), but it is important. I have never seen a Twitter thread be retweeted with explicit endorsement by so many accounts that I respect, including many that I would not normally expect to understand how toxic and dangerous the situation threatens to become. Here are some examples of what people said when retweeting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo make damn sure, I will put it here in its entirety. If you have not yet already, please read the whole thing. I would quibble over some minor details as I of course always would, but they matter little. This is the message everyone needs to hear.\\n\\n\\n\\nI turn the floor over.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey did indeed issue a court order to freeze users’ Bitcoins in self-custodial wallets, giving one of those great opportunities to note that this is not how any of this works.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAftermath\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen 6529 wrote that thread, the convoy was still a going concern. It was still plausible that however awful the precedent set by the financial authoritarianism and disregard for the rule of law, that one could be sufficiently terrified of a physical solution to think that such actions were necessary or at least useful.\\n\\n\\n\\nI was already confident of quite the opposite. Taking these actions galvanized people’s worst fears throughout not only Canada but the world. However much forceful dissent and distrust of the system was present before, it will doubtless be much, much more present going forward. The only way that is in the government’s interest is if it wants this fight in order to further suspend freedom and democracy and destroy the rule of law that much faster.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo the extent these people are capable of having points at all, the suspension of freedom and democracy and the destruction of rule of law is the point. Setting a precedent that the government can cast out your entire family and anyone helping you on a whim is the point.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can I be confident that we know this?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe protests were broken up only days later by arresting those present and towing trucks. Those invoking these financial penalties and requirements doubtless knew that this was the plan. Given that this was the plan, the financial measures were clearly completely unnecessary – things would have played out on the ground in exactly the same way.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe financial actions doubtless made it harder to hire lawyers for those arrested, but that hardly seems like a motivation that should make us feel better.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authorities said that they would be imposing these measures retroactively on people who left voluntarily and thus avoided being arrested.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the opposite of what you do to break up a protest, because you withdraw the motive to go home. I can’t help but notice the penalty for lateness is death when they intend to actively hunt after the protestors who leave without any need to arrest them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe authorities said after the protests were broken up that the situation that required the Act was still present. What else in the world could this be referring to? Is this a permanent emergency because people might try something again at some point in the future? Or was the thing that required the act the institution of these financial measures on a permanent basis?\\n\\n\\n\\nPart of my explanation for this is motive ambiguity. One shows one’s dedication to the cause by intentionally inflicting maximum harm, thus proving one is not going to be distracted by worries about morality or what third parties might come to harm. The more damage one can do, the better the demonstration – the cruelty is the point, not because one values cruelty, but to show one is not against cruelty or not supporting freedom, the best proof of which is to go as far as possible in the other direction.\\n\\n\\n\\nI say ‘to the extent these people are capable of having points at all’ because they importantly have lost at least some and perhaps all ability to have points. This is important.\\n\\n\\n\\nThree Sides to Every Story\\n\\n\\n\\nThe counterargument is presumably some form of ‘they know not what they do’ where those involved are so lost they have no ability to think or reason on such levels, and they are doing things of the form ‘convoy bad, people no like convoy, what tools we have to hurt convoy’ without any model of why such actions would accomplish anything or much care about whether they do. Slash perhaps the idea that one must Take Action and this is action, demands by various enforcers for More Power and More Authority to Do Something, with or without the general instinct that fear will keep the local systems in line without thinking that anything will slip through their fingers.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn that model, these dynamics need not involve much agency or intent. The thing ramps up continuously on its own through people following local incentive gradients, resulting in a state that no one especially wanted, but also that they did not concern themselves much with avoiding until it was far too late and the frog was already boiled to death. On my stack is writing the post Policy Debates Should Appear One Sided (the flip side of this), but (and also because) there is still always (at minimum) another side to the story.\\n\\n\\n\\nI noted last time that the reason Trudeau and the Canadian Government seemed to be so taken by surprise, had so much paralysis in terms of getting together a physical response and ended up flailing around with financial assets was because such people have often lost the ability to reason at all about underlying physical reality.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus I frame the heart of the conflict between different simulacra levels. The fight is between those who live primarily in simulacra levels one, where they interact with and attempt to model and alter physical reality, and those at simulacra levels three, where one cares mostly about signaling group memberships and loyalties, and often also level four where they end up using vibes and associations of various level three moves in an instinctual way that they have learned is associated with success, and lose all ability to reason or make plans in a coherent way at all, let alone model the physical world.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn alternative framing of a similar divide by The Upheaval is ‘the Physicals versus the Virtuals.’ In this divide, The Virtuals deal with information and effectively form a ruling class, but because they still depend on physical reality they must continue to rely on the Physicals, and we all know how such science fiction tales usually end.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut have a little sympathy for them: they do this not just because it is cynically convenient (though it is), but because this is literally the only way they know how to navigate and influence the world. The post-modern fish swims in a narrative sea, and their first reaction is always to try to control it (through what the CCP calls “discourse power”) because at heart they well and truly believe in the idea of the “social construction of reality,” as Lasch pointed out in the quote at top. If there is no fixed, objective truth, only power, then the mind’s will rules the world. Facts can be reframed as needed to create the story that best produces the correct results for Progress (this is why you will find journalists are now professionally obsessed with “storytelling” rather than reporting facts).…That Trudeau’s government would choose to jettison any remaining illusion of Canada still being a liberal democracy just to harm their political class enemies isn’t too surprising. It’s their method of doing so that is particularly striking: control over digital financial assets is pretty much the ultimate leverage now available to the Virtuals. We should expect more use of this tool around the world anywhere the Physicals continue to revolt against their masters.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Physicals must be concerned with non-socially-constructed Truth because otherwise reality will bite them in the ass. The Virtuals have their asses covered, so they are unconcerned.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a lot of merit in this framing, but it still seems important that those who are concerned with Truth and who do not wish it to be socially constructed should then side with the Physicals, even if in their world they deal with information. And indeed, the first reply to the person who linked me to this says ‘I am a Virtual yet still side with the protesters.’\\n\\n\\n\\nAnother recent version of the same thing was, yes, wordcels and shape rotators. Shape rotators concern themselves with reality, wordcels only with symbols.\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd mysteriously, despite information being what most of Twitter and everyone I know do all day, everyone wants to think of themselves as a shape rotator.\\n\\n\\n\\nConsider:\\n\\n\\n\\nLoose Isomorphisms\\n\\n\\n\\nThe rotator  wordcel axis also happens to map to some other common ones. I might expand on these later but I’ll just list them for now.\\n\\n\\n\\nspacing guild v. bene gesserit\\n\\n\\n\\nautism v. schizophrenia\\n\\n\\n\\nsan francisco v. new york\\n\\n\\n\\nintuition v. formalism\\n\\n\\n\\nempiricist v. rationalist\\n\\n\\n\\ndeep learning v. crypto\\n\\n\\n\\ncapitalists v. socialists\\n\\n\\n\\napolitical v. political\\n\\n\\n\\ngeometers v. algebraists\\n\\n\\n\\nI am confident that the person who wrote that list thinks of the lefthand shape-rotator side as ‘the good side’ and the righthand wordcel side as ‘the bad side.’\\n\\n\\n\\nHere’s one of them as text, by the author of the piece above:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe list is a broad-based statement of values and world models. It is a claim that empiricists make the important discoveries and build great world-changing capitalist companies using their intuition to work on geometrically-based deep learning algorithms while all having autism and living in San Francisco and staying apolitical. In their spare time they read Dune and root for the spacing guild.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhereas when Vitalik saw this he said ‘wait crypto is shape rotation,’ the same way I see it and think ‘New York and rationalist (and also empiricist though) are shape rotation and San Francisco is wordcel.’ And if you ask a socialist familiar with the terms, I predict most of them will claim socialism is shape rotation and capitalism is wordcel.\\n\\n\\n\\nWho is a ‘real American’ versus whatever the other option is? I’ll tell you who isn’t not one, it’s whichever American is speaking. You know who is ‘out of touch’? Not my friends and allies, that’s who. There is a right amount of touch to be in, it isn’t maximal, but that is never what people are debating. Same principle.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe initial dialectic tactic was to take a superficial division between one simulacra-3/4 alliance of wordcels/virtuals/politicians/whatevers and another that is also that, and frame it as your side being spare rotators/physicals/outsiders/whichevers, and that everyone has to pick a side or the awful other side full of wordcels/virtuals/politicians will win.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe new tactic is to deny that there were ever any meaningful physical reality at all.\\n\\n\\n\\nFraming this as a battle between teams, of course, is playing into the whole idea of socially constructed reality and virtual wordcels operating on Simulacra-3, whereas the whole point of noticing the divide is to do the other thing. Putting more of the right people in your coalition or having the right symbolic associations does not make one right – or if you think it does, then you have already chosen your side.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn this context, we can revisit the Tyler Cowen concept of looking for the strong analytical thinkers.\\n\\n\\n\\nLook for strong analytical abilities, and if you don’t see it, run the other way.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it makes more sense, although it risks continuing to play into the underlying problem by looking at coalitions and choosing sides on that basis.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn that light, it is important to note that this principle has now reversed itself.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen one looks at the original convoy, one indeed struggles to find strong analytical thinkers.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet the same can be said for Trudeau and the rest of the government response. In no way does it reflect strong analytical thinking or thinkers.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Canadian government, not the convoy, is the relevant actor here. It no longer much matters how it started, only how it’s going.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the early stages, the strong analytical thinkers had a wide variety of reactions to the situation. But you know what all the strong analytical thinkers are doing now, after the freezing of bank accounts?\\n\\n\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, at least in the informational world I have constructed for myself, all of them stand united. I have not seen a single attempt, however weak, to defend the actions taken or even to claim they are of minimal importance.\\n\\n\\n\\nIncluding people whose views mostly differ strongly from most others in my orbit. Whatever they think off arresting the protestors and of the original convoy, everyone’s reaction to the freezing of accounts is the same, and looks like some version of these examples.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt might be time to run the other way, and perhaps shout it from the rooftops.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat To Do Now?\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are two categories of things to do, the general and the personal, with some amount of overlap.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe general would involve political action, with some combination of education, persuasion, awareness raising, voice raising, lobbying, working with those who set such policies in various capacities, academic work, voting, lawyers and so on to combat the rise of such authoritarian policies and protect the freedom to transact, the rule of law, the right to due process and so forth. Hopefully without getting your accounts frozen. Others can speak better than I can on this, but I will note that I consider this policy debate sufficiently one-sided that I would support it being what the EAs call a ‘cause area.’\\n\\n\\n\\nThe personal involves protecting yourself and those you care about against the threat of such actions coming for you. At some point in the future, this could happen to you. What is acceptable now may not be acceptable in the future, in a ‘first they come’ kind of way, and such winds can change quite fast. Or at a minimum, the need to ensure that this does not happen will constrain your behavior and your freedom and cause you much stress.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt need not be about taking explicit political or other action. Sometimes this will be a pure misunderstanding or other error. People get frozen out because of mistaken identity or an ‘abundance of caution.’ A very good friend of mine had it happen due to a tax dispute in which the government was neither correct nor communicative and it caused tons of trouble, although this has since been cleared up.\\n\\n\\n\\nThus, the value of taking actions to minimize one’s vulnerability to such actions was already important, and seems that much more important. Think about what would happen if your assets, and those of your family, were frozen right now. Your bank accounts are gone, your credit cards do not work. You can’t get new ones. What would you do? How would you keep a roof over your head and pay for food?\\n\\n\\n\\nEnsure that you have answers to those questions. There are a variety of ways to at least partially protect yourself, including self-custodial cryptocurrency and cold hard cash or other physical assets, especially ones that travel.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’ve seen a bunch of ‘guess it’s time to get into crypto’ sentiment recently, and I am surprised it was not reflected more in prices. For example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n(Nothing here is ever investment advice and that goes double for crypto, but in case anyone was confused about this, such posts are Not The Way. Asking the internet in general is definitely not the way to get good information or advice on such matters. Find someone you trust who knows their stuff and can walk you through it or point to a trustworthy guide.)\\n\\n\\n\\nOne additional important way to deal with this, that is a complement to your own safe assets, is to have people you can trust to come to your aid, despite the situation. Having true friends and family at your side is one of the best defenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nAt Substack the site has expressed a strong commitment to resisting censorship, but they use Stripe as their sole payment processor, and Stripe has made it clear they play ball. Getting cut off from writing income is not the same as having one’s bank accounts frozen, but it is a clear point of vulnerability especially if Stripe was told to cut off the entire site until the disapproved content was taken down. It needs to be fixed.\\n\\n\\n\\nIs it a pain to have three distinct copies of every post in different places? Yes it is quite the pain especially when I need to edit to fix mistakes. Yet I do not make one or two of them into link posts, because this way provides a robust backup system. In order to take me down, one would need to take down all three copies.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Convoy Links and Thoughts\\n\\n\\n\\nSame as it ever was, the Canadian Parliament delayed their session evaluating the invoking of the Emergencies Act due to the emergency the act was invoked against.\\n\\n\\n\\nRather than decry such moves, instead mainstream media has joined the move against those who donated money.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGood to see Representative Ilhan Omar standing up for the obvious even with rolls reversed, which is sadly a rarity these days. Such principle is not by default rewarded. Replies are full of demands that she do things such as ‘stay in her lane.’ Getting praise from Fox News does not exactly make her life better.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe journalist in question moved her tweets to protected before I could write this post, losing us a number of details, which is my fault for not getting the screenshots right away.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is also the obvious, which is that the word ‘freedom’ has now been associated with the convoy, and has always meant freedom, from the Washington Post editorial page:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe logic in the post, as far as I can tell is:\\n\\n\\n\\nCanada (and the USA) restricted the freedom of non-white people.Thus, freedom is white.Thus, a claim of entitlement to freedom is white supremacy.Freedom is slavery, and presumably ignorance is strength.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe response to this was the stage-1-clown-makeup that no one actually believes this, it’s some sort of ingroup virtue signaling cascade causing such words to be written, but somehow that does not bring me comfort. It brings up the question a commenter asked me a while ago about why New York Times is on the banned list but other places like Washington Post are acceptable. I’d like to say it’s a matter of degree and that I’ve found Washington Post’s news reporting to mostly be acceptable, and also editorials mostly don’t count it’s fine to air different points of view, but ‘Scott Alexander was my friend and it is personal’ is doubtless doing a bunch of work.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom January 10, Unheard lets some participants talk. Big ‘and you can’t make me’ energy combined with ‘well actually sure you can, I need my truck.’\\n\\n\\n\\nPirate Wires covers the situation before the full ‘freeze all the bank accounts’ plan became clear, is mostly already there anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\nCommon Sense was there a while ago, and is here to remind us.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Canadian government put this out on February 18, after doing all this and while they were breaking up the protests with arrests.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStraight.

       " {'text': 'My dad’s a retired science teacher, so my little brother and I began playing the “I’m not touching you!” game unusually early.In case you’re not familiar with “I’m not touching you!”, here’s how it works.Step 1: Ask your parents (or the internet or whatever) why you don’t fall through the floor.Step 2: Learn about electrostatic repulsion, and conclude that things never “really touch”.Step 3: Poke your sibling.Step 4: When they say “Stop touching me!”, insist that “I’m not touching you!”Step 5: Find out whether your parents consider “technically correct” to be an adequate defense. (They don’t.)It is true that things do not touch in the way we naively imagine. Their component atoms’ electrons repel each other. “Perfectly direct contact” does not ordinarily happen.\\xa0Nonetheless, there is a big difference between the “not touching” that’s happening when you poke your sibling, and the “not touching” that’s happening when you point at your sibling from three meters away.Similarly, there is no unmediated subjective experience of the territory. When you poke your little brother’s arm, your brain does something with those nerve signals to turn them into phenomena, into the subjective experience of tactile sensations. The sensations are not the nerve signals. There is always processing distance between your subjective experiences and whatever is happening to your sense organs.However, some processing distances are smaller than others.\\xa0Consider the processing distance between [the electrostatic repulsion at your fingertip] and [your plan to test how upset you can make your brother before your parents intervene]. Although your plan exists mostly inside your head, it definitely has something to do with that electrostatic repulsion, in about the same way that a pointing finger has something to do with whatever it’s pointing at. A plan is made of anticipations, imaginings, desires, and so forth; yet it isn’t completely out of contact with the territory.But consider the distance between [the electrostatic repulsion at your fingertip] and [the immediate tactile sensations of your finger]. The subjective sensations still exist only inside your head, but the processing distance is much smaller. Those sensations put you in closer contact with the underlying reality of electrostatic repulsion. Compared to imaginings or desires, they are much more tightly entangled with what’s happening out there.Here’s how I think contact with the territory works.\\xa0For me to make contact with my brother’s arm, there are three conditions that must be met, three entities that must coincide.Presence. An arm must be present. There must be a region of territory available to be contacted. I can’t make much contact with my brother’s arm if he’s in another city.Personhood. There must be a contactor, a mind participating in the experience of contact, a place where attending occurs. I can’t make contact in the relevant sense if I’m under general anesthesia, even if my brother’s arm happens to brush my finger while I’m under.Sensation. There must be an experience of pressure on the skin of my hand as it presses up against my brother’s arm. There has to be some kind of sensation I might become aware of. I can’t make contact if I’ve lost all the nerves in my fingers to frostbite.Presence, personhood, and sensation. Lose any of the three of these, and there’s no longer contact in the sense I mean.But note that each of these conditions can obtain to a greater or lesser extent, depending on the situation. It isn’t all or nothing.In the context of studying arms, a memory of an arm involves greater presence than does the description of a fictional arm in a novel. A photograph has more presence than a memory.Presence of arms: actual arm > photograph of an arm > memory of an arm > fictional description of an armPersonhood is similarly variable. A person’s body can be physically present while their mind is otherwise occupied. They can selectively disengage parts of themselves when encountering a topic they’d prefer not to think about, letting experiences “bounce off” or relegating them to a “sandbox” for safety. It’s possible to limit the mental space in which attending occurs, without eliminating it entirely—or to expand that space beyond what’s available by default. This is what phrases like “showing up”, “checking out”, and “blankface” refer to.Finally, just as a sighted person can wear sunglasses or even a blindfold, sensation isn’t all or nothing. It’s possible to be more or less numb to sensations at the point of contact, even when all your nerves are in working order.Numbness often happens when top-down processes overwrite bottom-up processes, as in the Ponzo illusion:\\xa0If the top blue line looks longer to you at first, it’s probably because you’re interpreting the visual sensations through an expectation that things near the bottom of the image are “closer”, while things near the top are “farther away”. If the top line were farther away, then it would have to be longer than the bottom line to produce the visual stimuli you encounter.This interpretation probably happens so quickly that your raw visual sensations are overwritten by it. To see the blue lines as the same length, if you even can, you have to deliberately back up and peel off a thick layer of perceptual interpretation, excavating sensations that correspond more directly to the lines themselves.But if you do peel back that interpretive layer, then you increase sensation at the point of contact with this image. It’s like removing your gloves and actually touching the snow. You are feeling more of the image itself, rather than feeling your own processing systems.There is a gradient from “seeing” (in the Holmesian sense) to “observation”, and it is identical to the gradient from low to high contact with the territory. Dial up presence, personhood, or sensation, and contact with the territory gets more direct, more naked. Gloves off, touching the snow. Dial them way down, and you’re floating miles above the real world.(The “how” is tricky. That’s a whole different sequence. But even before figuring out how to do it, it’s worth considering that there may exist the possibility of movement toward more direct contact. It can help a lot to merely be aware that your experiences exist somewhere along the gradient from low to high contact with the territory.)In the sentence “Knowing the territory takes patient and direct observation”, this is what I mean by “direct”. I mean showing up as a whole person, in the presence of real-world data, and getting your preconceptions out of the way so you can be sensitive to what is there.\\xa0Knowing the territory takes patient and naked observation.\\xa0',\n",

       " {'text': 'It\\'s currently hard to know where to start when trying to get better at thinking about alignment. So below I\\'ve listed a few dozen exercises which I expect to be helpful. They assume a level of background alignment knowledge roughly equivalent to what\\'s covered in the technical alignment track of the AGI safety fundamentals course. They vary greatly in difficulty - some are standard knowledge in ML, some are open research questions. I’ve given the exercises star ratings from * to *** for difficulty (note:\\xa0not for length of time to complete - many require reading papers before engaging with them). However, I haven\\'t tried to solve them all myself, so the star ratings may be significantly off.I\\'ve erred on the side of including exercises which seem somewhat interesting and alignment-related even when I\\'m uncertain about their value; when working through them, you should keep the question \"is this actually useful? Why or why not?\" in mind as a meta-exercise. This post will likely be updated over time to remove less useful exercises and add new ones.I\\'d appreciate any contributions of:Comments about which exercises seem most or least useful.Answers to the exercises.More exercises! The ideal exercises are nerdsnipe-style problems which can be stated clearly, and seem well-defined, but lead into interesting depths when explored.Reward learning* Look at the examples of human feedback mechanisms discussed in the\\xa0reward-rational implicit choice paper. Think of another type of human feedback. What is the choice set? What is the grounding function?*\\xa0This paper by Anthropic introduces a technique called context distillation. Describe this in terms of the reward-rational implicit choice framework.* Estimate the bandwidth of information conveyed by different types of human feedback. Describe a rough model for how this might change as training progresses. By contrast, how much information is conveyed by the choice of a programmatic reward function? (Consider both the case where the agent is given the exact reward function, and where it learns from reward observations.)* Look at the examples of biases discussed in\\xa0learning the preferences of ignorant agents. Identify another bias which similarly influences human decision-making. Describe an example situation where a human with that bias might make the wrong decision. Formulate an algorithm that infers that human’s true preferences.Some answers here.** Given that\\xa0humans can be assigned any values, why does reward learning ever work in practice?** Explain why\\xa0cooperative inverse reinforcement learning doesn’t solve the alignment problem.Answer here.Agency** In\\xa0this paper, researchers devised a test for whether a recurrent network is doing planning: by seeing whether its performance improves when given more time to “think” before it can act. In the AlphaGo paper, researchers compared the performance of their MCTS+neural network algorithm against the network alone. Think of some other test that we could run that would give us evidence about the extent to which some neural network is internally doing planning.* Consider\\xa0HCH, an attempted formalisation of “a human’s enlightened judgment”. Why might an implementation of HCH not be aligned? What assumptions would be needed to prevent that?*** In a later post, Paul defines a\\xa0stronger version of HCH which “increases the complexity-theoretic expressiveness of HCH. The old version could be computed in EXPTIME, while the new version can compute any decidable function.” Try to rederive a new version of HCH with these properties.Answer here.* Ask the\\xa0OpenAI API about what steps it would take to perform some long-term plan. Work in groups: think of a task that you expect it will be difficult to generate a good plan for, and then see who can design a prompt that will produce the best plan from the API.* Some steps of a plan generated by the API can also be performed by the API - e.g. a step which requires writing a poem about a given topic. What’s the hardest task you can find for which the API can not only generate a plan, but also perform each of the steps in that plan?**\\xa0Pearl argues that neural networks trained on supervised or self-supervised data can’t learn to reason about interventions and counterfactuals (see this post for an explanation of the distinction). What’s the strongest counterargument against his position?Reinforcement learning** How is supervised learning on reward-maximising trajectories related (mathematically) to policy gradient with sparse, binary rewards?** What decision theories are implemented by different RL algorithms?Some answers here.** What might lead an RL agent to learn a policy which sacrifices reward in its current episode to get higher reward in a later episode?Some answers in section 7 here.* Self-play in zero-sum two-player games converges to an optimal strategy (given sufficient assumptions about the model class). In other games, this isn’t the case - why not?** Evaluate\\xa0this paper (Reward is Enough). Does their argument hold up?** After doing that: consider a bird practicing singing, which listens to its own song, and does RL using the rule:\\xa0the better the song sounds, the higher the reward. But the bird is also deciding how much time to spend practicing singing versus foraging, etc. And the worse it sings, the more important it is to practice! So you really want the rule:\\xa0the worse the song sounds, the more rewarding it is to practice singing. How could you resolve this conflict?Some answers here.* Why can a behaviourally cloned policy perform well when run for a small set of timesteps, but poorly when run over a longer series of timesteps? How can this be fixed?Some answers here.** If a deep q-learning agent is trained in an environment where some actions lead to large negative rewards, it will never stop trying these actions (the policy will sometimes take these actions even when not randomly exploring due to epsilon exploration). Why does this happen? How could it be prevented?Some answers here.** RL agents have become capable of competent behaviour over longer and longer episodes. What difficulties arise in trying to measure improvements in how long they can act competently for? What metrics are most useful?The same question, but for sample efficiency rather than episode length.Some answers here.Neural networks* Consider\\xa0this paper on modularity in neural networks. Evaluate their metric of clustering; what others could we use instead?** Consider the following alignment proposal: a neural network has two output heads, one of which chooses actions, the other of which predicts the longer-term consequences of those actions. Suppose that we train the latter head to maximise human-evaluated prediction quality. What differences might we expect from backpropagating that loss all the way through the network, versus only backpropagating through the prediction head? What complications arise if we try to train the prediction head via RL? What advantages might there be of doing so?** “Gradient hacking” is a hypothesised phenomenon by which a model decides its actions partly on the basis of its observations of its own parameters, thereby changing the way its parameters are updated. Does the gradient hacking mechanism described in the linked post work? If not, does any variant of it work?Some answers here.* Read\\xa0Jacob Steinhardt’s list of examples of emergent shifts in machine learning. Can you think of any others? What about shifts that you expect in the near future?** What might it look like for the\\xa0circuits hypothesis to be false?*\\xa0This paper discusses the metric of “effective data transferred”. What are the limitations of this metric? What are some alternative ways to measure data transfer?Alignment theory* Consider extending reinforcement learning to the case where rewards can depend on the parameters of a model. Why do classic convergence proofs no longer work?*** Are there any limiting assumptions which might lead to interesting theoretical results?** One concern with proposals to train using loss functions that depend directly on parameters is that if we train a network to avoid carrying out any particular piece of cognition, that cognition will instead just be distributed across the network in a way that we can’t detect. Describe a toy example of a cognitive trait that we can currently detect automatically. Design an experiment to determine whether, after training to remove that trait, the network has learned to implement an equivalent trait in a less-easily-detectable way.*** Rederive some of the proofs in the following papers. For b) and c), explain what assumptions are being made about the optimality of the agents involved, and how they might break down in practice:Seeking Power is Convergently Instrumental in MDPsAI safety via debate (and see also\\xa0proofs about the effects of adding\\xa0cross-examination)Alignment proposals and complexity classes (and this follow-up)Some answers here.*** Produce a proposal for\\xa0the ELK prize (note that this requires engaging with the ELK writeup, which is very long).** Suppose that we’re training a model via behavioural cloning of a human, but the human starts off with different prior knowledge to the model (either more knowledge, or less knowledge). How might this lead the model to behave in a misaligned way?Some answers here.Agent foundations*\\xa0Open-source game theory**\\xa0Selection theorems**\\xa0Fixed point exercises*** The 5 and 10 problemEvolution and economics* An old study split insects into several groups which each lived together, and artificially selected in favour of smaller groups, in an attempt to study whether they would evolve to voluntarily restrain their breeding. Predict the outcome of the study.Some answers here. Did the bias discussed in this post influence your expectations?** What might explain why there are so few hermaphroditic animal species, given that every individual being able to bear children could potentially double the number of children in the next generation?Some answers here.* Read this post about\\xa0evolving to extinction. Mathematically demonstrate that segregation-distorters could in fact lead a species to evolve to extinction.* Evaluate\\xa0Fletcher and Doebeli’s model of the evolution of altruism.Use the model to show how\\xa0the green-beard effect could lead to the evolution of (a certain type of) altruism.Why are roughly equal numbers of males and females born in most species?Some answers here.* Comparing GDP across time requires reference to\\xa0a standard basket of goods and services. What difficulties might this cause in taking GDP comparisons at face value?Some answers here.** Evaluate\\xa0Roodman’s model of explosive economic growth.* In cooperative game theory, the “core” is the term for the set of allocations of payoffs to agents where no subset of the agents can form a coalition to improve their payoffs. For example, consider a group of N miners, who have discovered large bars of gold. Assume that two miners can carry one piece of gold, and so the payoff of any coalition S is floor(|S|/2). If N is even, then the core consists of the single payoff distribution where each miner gets ½. If N is odd, then the core is empty (because the miner who is left out can always make a better offer to some miner who currently has a gold-carrying partner). Identify the core for the following games:A game with 2001 players: 1000 of them have 1 left shoe, 1001 have 1 right shoe. A left-shoe/right-shoe pair can be sold for $10.Mr A and Mr B each have three gloves. Any two gloves make a pair that they can sell for $5.Answers here.* How should coalitions decide how to split the payoffs they receive? The concept of\\xa0Shapley values provides one answer.

       " {'text': \"Hi there. I’m a longtime LW-er posting under a pseudonym, in the hopes of being able to make my ignorance visible without unnecessary drama. Please don’t out me; it seems to me that the ability to expose one’s ignorance pseudonymously is a pro-epistemic norm that we’ll be better off having.Now that I’ve gotten that over with:I want to understand LW’s aversion to religion. I’m hoping some of you guys can help me model it. I’m also hoping to explain what is attractive to me about religion as an aid to forming accurate maps (including, attractive to me vis a vis my goal of making LW stronger/more successfully truth-seeking), and to see if some of you are willing and able to understand my perspective about this (“to pass my ITT,” is I think how you lot would say this?). I want to know whether, after you “pass my ITT,” you have anything to say back that makes me think my attraction to religion is something truth can destroy.What is LW’s objection to religion?Here’s my starting attempt at describing LW’s aversion to religion:1) Many religions claim things that are straightforwardly false (e.g., “Jesus physically rose from the dead.”) It’s harmful to believe false things.2) Human beings have an observable tendency to really persistently believe (or claim to believe) some obviously false things religions claim, compared to random obviously false things. This suggests to LW that religion is near a “fault line” in the human psyche, and if we go near that fault line our minds might start believing a lot of different false things, or might otherwise become less trustworthy. We don’t have a precise, high-confidence model of what exactly this “fault line” is, so it is safest to stay far away from religion, so as to reduce the odds of accidentally stumbling over the unknown “religion fault line” and having our minds go screwy.If you’re a LW-er who is averse to religion, and you have a couple minutes to make me smarter, I’d really appreciate a comment below from you (or a PM) about whether this (1 and 2 above) summarizes most of what drives your aversion to religion, or whether it’s missing something core to your reaction.How the above “objection to religion” sits with meObjection 1 seems valid and correct to me. I agree many religions claim many false things. Jesus did not physically rise from the dead; there was no message to Noah about a flood; etc. I also agree that false beliefs are often harmful, and that, as Eliezer argues, the resistance many religious people have to cryonics is a strong example of the false beliefs of religion causing important harm. I suspect my beliefs here are roughly that of many near the center of LW, although I may be missing something.Objection 2 is more confusing to me. Objection 2, in my current understanding, is a special case of “don’t expose yourself to a potentially compelling set of perspectives, because if you do you might become convinced by them, and then you’ll believe something false.” I am afraid of heuristics following this template. I agree, of course, that it’s bad to end up believing something false. But exposing myself to all the perspectives, and allowing myself to think everything through after exposure to all arguments and perspectives, is usually a better heuristic than “avoid thinking about X” for figuring out what’s true. (Think creationists saying “don’t listen to biologists, they’ll trick you.”)One place where I would be grateful for help: what exactly is the fault line near religion, if there is in fact a fault line there? The conjunction fallacy is in some sense a fault line in the human psyche, but it’s one we can name, can point to precisely, and can thereby become relatively immune to in the sense that one needn’t fear reading conjunctive futurism; one can simply read it, remember the conjunction fallacy, and try not to fall for the false parts. Is religion like this? Or is it a broader and more unknown set of fault lines that requires more caution? I would feel far better about the whole thing if we could make “watch out for religion” more similar to “watch out for the conjunction fallacy”: specific, verifiably a bias (or a set of biases), and sufficiently well characterized that, after training in recognizing the relevant biases, practicing religion (e.g. praying) would no longer much threaten a person's sanity.Why, and in what sense, I find religion attractiveTo be clear, I do not find “belief in a literal Jehovah who literally raised Jesus from the dead” attractive. That religion would include false beliefs, and false beliefs are harmful and not attractive.To describe what I do find attractive:Religion seems to me to be better (though still not great) at giving folks accurate, usable models of where to trust our maps vs where to have humility, and at giving folks accurate maps of what the heck it is to be a human being, related to other human beings, in the middle of this here universe.For example, when I contrast practitioners of most traditional religions (Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, various forms of traditional polytheistic religion, etc.) with most of those professing belief in what I’ll call “naive scientistic materialism,” it seems to me that the religious practitioners often do better in the following ways.Situating human life within temporal rhythms (daily/weekly, yearly, and across the lifetime). Honoring these rhythms communally.Most religions situate human life within a set of rhythms, including daily and weekly rhythms (e.g. “don’t work on the Sabbath”); yearly rhythms (e.g. “here is when we celebrate the harvest; here is when we atone, fast, and make an empty space for seeing past our egos”); and lifetime rhythms (e.g. “here is when we recognize a young person as having come of age; here is a ritual for marriage; here is a ritual for death.”)In contrast, many who profess what I’m calling “naive scientistic materialism” seem to me to eat, work, and sleep at all hours of the day and week in patterns that seem fairly unhealthy and unproductive to me. Many scientistic materialists seem to me to marry several times or not at all in patterns that I believe are less promoting of life, happiness, healthy children, and stable community than many traditional patterns; and to generally attempt to model themselves as rhythmless machines (“I just need to give my body 8 hours of sleep and 2,000 calories and then it ought to give me back the ability to do functional work”) in ways that seem to me to have inadequate respect for what I would call the sacred forces at work in the body, mind, and soul, and inadequate humility about our maps of the same.[1]Respect for folk ethicsMany religions claim that such things as courage, honesty, and hard work are virtues. (The specifics vary, but many religions claim something like that for some set of ‘traditional virtues.') In contrast, many scientistic materialists speak as though they have arbitrary personal preferences for e.g. courage or honesty as part of their arbitrary, purely individual, utility functions. (Eliezer admittedly does better here.)I think it’s, roughly speaking, more accurate to say “courage is a virtue” than to say “I personally value courage.” I personally enjoy the flavor of caramel. “Courage is a virtue” is not similar to my relationship to caramel; it’s a prediction that practicing courage will generally help a person to create good things broadly, and to have a right alignment of their soul. “Courage is a virtue” is a sentence, not about my map, but about the world.Folk ethics seems to me to be of real use for building viable organizations and relationships, and for keeping your soul in good working order. I think scientistic young people are often more confused than their religious counterparts here, due to being given less accurate maps. (This matters more for teens and twenties than for older folks, since young people are forced for lack of experience to rely more on outside maps.)Encouragement to bear and raise children, and to attend to the next generation. Offering shared communal patterns that make this easier.I suspect that religion (especially, communally practiced religion) makes it easier for people to create stable marriages and to raise children by providing shared maps of how to do this together. I suspect it also encourages more people to want these things by providing a more accurate map of their value, and a more accurate map of what kind of thing we humans are, such that we value children. (Again, providing accurate maps matters most for young people.)Many scientistic materialists seem in my experience to have difficulty finding anything to care about, partly because they are trying to follow an inaccurate map that tells them that they have a “utility function” that is mostly about themselves and their experience. Or they have inaccurate maps that tell them that their “values” are a thing they get to just make up according to what they think will get them social status or something, and these maps are also stupid and leave them adrift. Or they realize these maps have errors because they read the Sequences but are still similarly adrift.I suspect religion offers a more accurate map of the sense in which we are and are not isolated individuals, and of what matters to us deep down, and of at least some parts of how to live and orient given that.[2]The above list of places where religion seems to me to offer a more accurate map is not exhaustive; I am forcing myself to be brief. However, I believe it is representative.In conclusionI love the way LW seeks true beliefs and eschews false ones (including e.g. “Jesus physically rose from the dead.”) I wish to protect this and to not mess with this.In keeping with what I understand of LW's culture, I wish to investigate together the question of whether religion offers systematically more accurate maps of some important aspects of humankind's relationship to the universe, and to investigate whether this can be separated from religion’s admitted tendency to get stuck in specific false beliefs.I wish also to investigate the question of whether there is some terrible epistemic booby trap near religion, such that I or others should fear religious practice.I will be grateful for any assistance making more accurate maps of any of the above.Thank you.\\xa0^To translate my use of the word “sacred,” here, into local parlance: our maps of the body are not the body. Our maps of the mind are not the mind. Our maps of the soul are not the soul (root word “breath” — I’m using “soul” to mean whatever it is that goes out of a person at the moment of death). Also: each of the body, mind, and soul come from living processes that are smart, that non-randomly try to bring about good things, and that deserve our “respect” in the sense of not expecting a reliable lack of backfire from micromanaging them. Furthermore, these processes grew up in the context of our historical relationship to e.g. nature, to foraging within a natural context that included daily and yearly rhythms, and to being in certain kinds of relationships to particular kinds of human communities, and I know no good reason to expect them to be robust to the total disruption of these relationships. When I regard these processes as “sacred,” I remind myself to look at them in a manner appropriate to looking at old, wise things that use patterns not in my map to produce value I am dependent on.^I realize that Eliezer got a lot of this right, but I know nobody else who found his writing on morality compelling (nor did it work on me), and I think this was because he did not situate it within a larger accurate map in the way religion does. (Though he tried.) My guess is that Eliezer got values as right as he did partly because he grew up around religious people, and that his Sequence on morality did not manage to reproduce the component mental moves he used to get there. I am interested in whether seeking accurate maps near religion can help us do better.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"This post sketches two challenges to ARC's project around eliciting latent\\nknowledge that differ somewhat in kind from the challenges ARC is most\\nconcerned about. They relate to the difficulty in distinguishing beliefs\\nfrom other representations.\\nIntroduction\\nThe problem of ELK, as outlined in ARC's technical\\nreport,\\nis to figure out: given an AI trained to complete a task (the 'task AI'),\\nhow can we design a second AI (the 'reporter AI') that can answer\\nquestions about how the task AI understands the world. If we can know what\\nthe task AI is thinking, we can better assess whether its decisions are\\ndangerous.\\nThe central challenge identified by ARC to solving the problem of ELK\\nconcerns the possibility that the reporter AI will not learn to answer\\nquestions using what the task AI believes (e.g. answering honestly), but\\ninstead answer questions using what a human observer might think is the\\ncase on the basis of the available evidence (answering empathetically). We\\ntrain the reporter AI to answer based on the facts as we understand them\\n(and know the task AI to understand them) in relatively simple cases. We\\nhope that the reporter will answer questions in more complex cases based\\non how the task AI understands the world, but it might instead answer\\nbased on what it thinks a human would mistakenly believe. If the human\\nquestioner is ignorant of some complex details that the task AI knows, the\\nreporter AI might choose to leave them out to tell a simpler story that\\nwill satisfy the questioner. It is not obvious how to train an AI to\\nanswer honestly rather than empathetically.\\nWhile this is a significant challenge, I don't think it is the only\\nchallenge for ELK. In thinking through the problem, I became worried about\\nseveral others. I here describe two other challenges. Though they are\\nsomewhat speculative, ARC aims for a solution to the problem of ELK that deals\\nwith the worst case, and these challenges fall under that umbrella.\\nEven if we figure out how to make an honest rather than a empathetic\\nreporter, these challenges will remain.\\n1.) The Right Representation Challenge\\nWe do not know how the task AI might encode the the things that it\\nbelieves, but what it knows about the world must somehow be reflected in\\nits neural activity. For simplicity, let's suppose that the task AI utilizes\\nexplicit independent representational states that are encoded in its\\nnetwork in something vaguely like the way sentences are written in a book. The\\nreporter AI would need to figure out where in the network these sentences\\nare recorded. It would then have to figure out how to interpret the\\nsentences and use them to provide answers to questions in English.\\nThe reporter AI would also need to figure out which sentences recorded in\\nthe task AI's network are really believed and which sentences are recorded\\nfor other reasons. The task AI might produce a variety of representations\\nthat it doesn't fully believe (i.e. doesn't straightforwardly rely on to\\nmake decisions) for various purposes. If we just scan the network for\\nsentences, we may find sentences that it doesn't quite believe. These may\\nstill correlate with what it does believe in training scenarios, and so\\na reporter AI might learn to use them to answer questions. If the reporter\\nlatches on to those sentences, then it might give misleading answers once\\noutside of training.\\nConsider the following possibilities:\\n\\n\\nThe task AI makes predictions using the simulated mental states of various agents. In the central case of the report, the task is to prevent\\na thief from stealing a diamond -- the task AI might keep track of what\\nthe thief believes is happening, what a security guard thinks is\\nhappening, what other would-be thieves might later believe happened, etc.\\nIf our AI is sufficiently careful, it might keep track of what some\\npossible observers believe is happening. Perhaps it would simulate what\\nother superintelligent AIs with access to its sensors would think is\\nhappening. Depending on its purview, these might be reasonable things for\\nit to consider. If there are some possible agents that happen to often\\nagree with the task AI (such as hypothetical superintelligent AIs with\\naccess to its sensors), our reporter might have a hard time figuring out\\nwhich representations it should use to answer questions.\\n\\n\\nThe task AI utilizes a parliamentarian architecture in which it's\\nopinions are distributed over multiple specialized sub-agents, such that\\nwhat it thinks is a function of those sub-agents. This has been a popular\\nmodel for the human brain, so it seems conceivable that an AI would work\\nthis way. The sub-agents would have their own beliefs. Sometimes those\\nbeliefs would be wrong, but some sub-agents might be usually correct, at\\nleast in training. Consider how you would go about deciding what\\nthe US Senate currently collectively believes. A good strategy may just be to ask\\nJoe Manchin. This strategy may stop working in 2023. Our reporter might similarly be inclined to identify one\\nparliamentarian and report its representations. Even if the reporter decides to\\naggregate the representations of the relevant agents, it may have trouble figuring\\nout how to do this correctly. There may be many good but not quite right\\napproaches to aggregation. It isn't obvious that an AI well trained on\\na simple data set will succeed in finding the right way to aggregate.\\n\\n\\n2.) The Creative Interpretation Challenge\\nCreative interpretation is the process through which we infer implicit\\nrepresentations by means of explicit representations. We use creative\\ninterpretation when reading fiction or watching movies. Some aspects of\\nthe plot are not explicitly depicted, but are implied by what is depicted.\\nFor instance, movies rarely explicitly say how much time passes between\\nscenes. We infer from contextual cues that it was a few hours, or a day,\\nor a few weeks.\\nIf a reporter does utilize some explicit representations, it likely won't\\nrecord everything that it knows about the world explicitly. Some of its\\nbeliefs must be inferred from what it does explicitly represent and how it\\nworks with those representations. Some of its beliefs may depend on what\\nis missing from its explicit representations or may depend on patterns of\\nwhat it explicitly represents. A reporter is thus likely to need to do\\nsome creative interpretation in order to suss out the task AI's full\\nbeliefs.\\nCreative interpretation of a sort may be stretched even to cases where\\nthere are no explicit representations. Some beliefs may be more concrete\\nor easier to access than others. In such cases, creative interpretation\\nmight involve the inference of less easy to access facts from more easy to\\naccess facts.\\nGiven that a reporter needs to do some creative interpretation, the worry\\nis that it may do more than is appropriate. Compare the legitimate\\ncreative interpretation of a novel by a careful reader with the kind of\\nthing a lazy student who didn't read a few chapters does when writing\\na book report. They infer what must have happened from what they know.\\nA reporter which is good at interpreting some things may be bad at\\ninterpreting others. If it is lazy, it may just try to figure out from\\ncontext what the task AI believes given a few snippets that are\\nparticularly easy to decipher.\\nThe challenge is to make sure that our reporter isn't inferring some of\\nthe things it translates infelicitously. It is ok if our reporter is like\\nthe average viewer of a movie. It is not ok if our reporter is like a lazy\\nEnglish student bullshitting through a book report. We know what\\ndistinguishes appropriate creative interpretation in books and movies. It\\nisn't obvious how to distinguish good cases of creative inference from bad\\ncases of inference in representational systems that we don't understand.\\n\",\n",

       " {'text': 'In which I review Václav Havel’s essay on “The Power of the Powerless” before Scott Alexander totally steals my thunder.Václav Havel’s The Power of the Powerless is fascinating and surprising. The purpose of this review is to summarize it in such a tantalizing (and lengthy) way that you stop reading this and go look up Havel’s original instead.Its context is Czechoslovakia in 1978. The country has been behind the Iron Curtain for thirty years, and ten years have passed since the brief experiment in political liberalization known as the “Prague Spring” which had been quickly choked off by a Soviet-led invasion.Havel was a Czech playwright with international renown, whose works were banned in his own country. In 1977 he helped to spearhead “Charter 77”—a document that called on the government to respect human rights and its own Constitution.Charter 77 was prompted by the prosecution of members of the rock band “The Plastic People of the Universe”—the “Pussy Riot” of their day. The government took the threat represented by the Charter seriously—it persecuted its signers and made it illegal to print or distribute the text. In 1979, Havel would be sent to prison for four years for his role in advocating for the Charter.While Havel wrote The Power of the Powerless, he was under constant police surveillance and harassment for his Charter 77 activism. Meanwhile he was being noticed by freedom-loving people around the world and being hailed as a prominent Soviet-bloc dissident.The “Post-Totalitarian” SystemHe begins his argument by examining the system the “dissidents” are up against. It’s a strange new form of tyranny—a dictatorship not by a person or people, but by a bureaucracy and by certain principles and external contingencies (the primary one being that the Soviet Union intends to maintain Czechoslovakia as an obedient client state). So this is not the sort of dictatorship that can be threatened by attacks on a particular person or clique.Havel refers to this system as “post-totalitarian” (at least in the translation I read). This is confusing, as it seems at first to imply that it is no longer totalitarian, which isn’t the case. “Neototalitarian” might have been more apt.Czechoslovakia (and the Soviet Union and its client states collectively) was ruled in part by an ideology—almost a religion—that had proven to be a tempting refuge for confused, uprooted, and alienated people. “Of course, one pays dearly for this low-rent home: the price is abdication of one’s own reason, conscience, and responsibility, for an essential aspect of this ideology is the consignment of reason and conscience to a higher authority. The principle involved here is that the center of power is identical with the center of truth.”He anticipates the argument that though this ideology is dominant and everpresent, few people really believe its platitudes. They’re like schoolchildren reciting the Pledge of Allegiance without paying attention to the words because it’s what is expected of them. To meet this argument Havel introduces us to a grocer:The Obedient GrocerIn the window of the grocery is a sign that reads “Workers of the world, unite!”What does the grocer mean by putting this sign in the window? Not that he is enthusiastic about global worker unity and wants to spread the word about it. The real message on the sign reads something like this: “I, the grocer X⸺, live here and I know what I must do. I behave in the manner expected of me. I can be depended upon and am beyond reproach. I am obedient and therefore I have the right to be left in peace.” The message is not meant for the grocer’s customers, but for officials who might suspect him or for informers who might care to turn him in.https://twitter.com/slatestarcodex/status/1495532084189966342If the grocer had to put that implicit message explicitly in his window, he might be embarrassed to be seen kowtowing in such a way, but by genuflecting in this indirect manner he saves face. If you ask him why he has the sign in his window, he can answer “What’s wrong with the workers of the world uniting?” and protect his dignity. In this way a gesture of obedience and subservience is disguised by ideology as one of solidarity and empowerment.IdeologyIdeology, Havel summarizes, “offers human beings the illusion of an identity, of dignity, and of morality while making it easier for them to part with them.… It is a veil behind which human beings can hide their own fallen existence, their trivialization, and their adaptation to the status quo. It is an excuse that everyone can use, from the greengrocer, who conceals his fear of losing his job behind an alleged interest in the unification of the workers of the world, to the highest functionary, whose interest in staying in power can be cloaked in phrases about service to the working class. The primary excusatory function of ideology, therefore, is to provide people, both as victims and pillars of the post-totalitarian system, with the illusion that the system is in harmony with the human order and the order of the universe.”Today’s tyrannies are too large and complex and cannot be held together by force and fear alone. They require their subjects not merely to submit passively to but to participate actively in their own subjection. Ideology is the mechanism to accomplish this.Individuals need not believe all these mystifications, but they must behave as though they did, or they must at least tolerate them in silence, or get along well with those who work with them. For this reason, however, they must live within a lie. They need not accept the lie. It is enough for them to have accepted their life with it and in it. For by this very fact, individuals confirm the system, fulfill the system, make the system, are the system.Once you make the decision to adopt the ideological mask for your subservient behavior—like the grocer putting the sign in his window—you become a part of this glue that affixes ideology over reality and gives ideology power. It doesn’t matter that you inwardly don’t really believe the explicit message of the ideology, because the explicit message isn’t the important one, and it doesn’t matter if you believe it or not so long as you agree to continue acting as though you did.While ideology is central to the post-totalitarian power structure, the interests of the structure itself are paramount, and the ideology—or the interpretation of it anyway—will tend to be subordinate to it. The tighter the control that the government exercises over communication and expression, the better it will be able to enforce and manipulate the orthodox interpretation of the ideology and the more the ideology will come to float far above reality, more-or-less completely detached from it: “a world of appearances, a mere ritual, a formalized language deprived of semantic contact with reality and transformed into a system of ritual signs that replace reality with pseudo-reality.”For example, in China today, “communism” is still the name given to the sacred ideology that is said to govern the system, but its meaning has come a long way: now it means the total state-enforced subjection of the working class to a small minority of fantastically wealthy private owners of the means of production (the wealth of China’s National Congress makes the U.S. Congress look like a bunch of ordinary middle-class schmoes). It’s still “communism” you’re expected to be loyal to, the flag is still red, that’s still Mao’s face staring back at you from the money, and you can still signal your loyalty to the system with the same empty platitudes about the rule of the working class—but the system doesn’t care about the explicit meaning of the platitudes any more than you do.Because ideology can become so absurdly detached from reality in this way, it can be a real art to try to maintain your fiction of adherence to it. Because of this, “the virtuosity of the ritual” comes to be more important than actually being able to attach meaning to what you are doing or saying. Aspects of the ritual and of the ideology come to represent only each other and never come down to earth. This can cause the ideology to detach even from the bureaucracy it was designed to serve, until it becomes an independent, malignant, power-appropriating memetic menace all its own.At this stage, when the ideology is serving itself more than it serves the bureaucracy, the power structure stops attracting the ambitious and starts attracting the faceless—empty suits—people who can articulately and cleverly engage in the virtuosity of the ritual but who don’t seem to have much going on outside of this arena of rhetorical swamp gas and who are so thoughtless that they have thoroughly internalized the ideology’s criteria of success and prestige.If a Frankenstein’s Monster ideology like this is so powerful that it can eventually even conquer and press into service the post-totalitarian dictatorship itself, what hope do we have? It is this: the ideology “is built on lies [and] works only as long as people are willing to live within the lie.”Who Enforces the Ideology?What if our grocer were to stop living in the lie in one little way: by not hanging the sign in his window that means nothing to him. Well, what possible difference could that make? It’s unlikely any of his customers even notice the sign. The sign is not meant to be read individually, anyway, but “to form part of the panorama of everyday life.” It is as a contributor to this panorama that the grocer serves the system. The message of the panorama is not the message on the sign but this message: “this sign-hanging is what the ideology demands of us today and we are complying.” Those who hang the signs are complying with the ideology and expressing the ideology’s demands by the same action: simultaneously the voice of command and the posture of submission.This has a pernicious psychological effect. The latent consciousness that you are both victim and perpetrator of this ideological control influences you to identify with the ideology. You feel better both in submitting and in commanding if you think you are doing so in service of an ideology you believe in, so you try to believe that you believe in this weird, untethered, nonsensical ideology—and you come to see attacks against the ideology as threats to you personally.Thus the conflict between the aims of life and the aims of the system is not a conflict between… the rulers and the ruled.… In the post-totalitarian system, this line runs de facto through each person, for everyone in his own way is both a victim and a supporter of the system. What we understand by the system is not, therefore, a social order imposed by one group upon another, but rather something which permeates the entire society and is a factor in shaping it, something which may seem impossible to grasp or define (for it is in the nature of a mere principle), but which is expressed by the entire society as an important feature of its life.…It can happen and did happen only because there is obviously in modern humanity a certain tendency toward the creation, or at least the toleration, of such a system. There is obviously something in human beings which responds to this system, something they reflect and accommodate, something within them which paralyzes every effort of their better selves to revolt. Human beings are compelled to live within a lie, but they can be compelled to do so only because they are in fact capable of living in this way. Therefore not only does the system alienate humanity, but at the same time alienated humanity supports this system as its own involuntary master plan, as a degenerate image of its own degeneration, as a record of people’s own failure as individuals.Alongside the striving for dignity, integrity, and personality that we naturally value and treasure in ourselves, says Havel, there lives a less-acknowledged, sinister striving “to merge with the anonymous crowd and to flow comfortably along with it down the river of pseudolife.”The Disobedient GrocerSo if going along with the lie means not just submitting to the system, but enforcing the system, what is the alternative for people who find the system intolerable? What if the grocer stops participating in the lie and starts living in the truth?Well, first and most obviously, the system retaliates against him. And since the system is enforced not just by the officials who overtly persecute him but by everyone, they as part of their life-in-the-lie must also shun him. Does he then just become a vivid display of the danger of rebellion—useful to the regime and no threat to it? According to Havel, no: the grocer’s quixotic act is indeed a serious threat to the system:By breaking the rules of the game, he has disrupted the game as such. He has exposed it as a mere game. He has shattered the world of appearances, the fundamental pillar of the system. He has upset the power structure by tearing apart what holds it together. He has demonstrated that living a lie is living a lie. He has broken through the exalted façade of the system and exposed the real, base foundations of power. He has said that the emperor is naked. And because the emperor is in fact naked, something extremely dangerous has happened: by his action, the greengrocer has addressed the world. He has enabled everyone to peer behind the curtain. He has shown everyone that it is possible to live within the truth. Living within the lie can constitute the system only if it is universal. The principle must embrace and permeate everything. There are no terms whatsoever on which it can co-exist with living within the truth, and therefore everyone who steps out of line denies it in principle and threatens it in its entirety.The biggest vulnerability of the ideologically-ruled post-totalitarian system is its unmooring from reality. But this vulnerability only becomes a liability when the system is brought into contrast with reality—and the system works hard to ensure that this doesn’t happen; that’s the point of the panorama of platitudes and of the conscription of the grocer to help deploy it.In the post-totalitarian system, therefore, living within the truth has more than a mere existential dimension (returning humanity to its inherent nature), or a noetic dimension (revealing reality as it is), or a moral dimension (setting an example for others). It also has an unambiguous political dimension. If the main pillar of the system is living a lie, then it is not surprising that the fundamental threat to it is living the truth. This is why it must be suppressed more severely than anything else.Truth-ForceHavel believes the lie can never gain total control of someone. There’s always a seed of truth remaining. The lie, because it so vigorously claims to be the truth and claims to be a route to authenticity, reinforces the idea that there is such a thing as truth and authenticity and that these things are valuable. The truth, then, is not exterminated in the post-totalitarian system, but continues to flow through society like an underground stream. Those who decide to live in the truth are not, therefore, isolated and having to invent themselves from scratch, but they’re able to tap into this reservoir.Because the post-totalitarian system is so detached from and hostile to the truth, the flow of this underground stream can evade its notice, “and by the time it finally surfaces into the light of day as an assortment of shocking surprises to the system, it is usually too late to cover them up in the usual fashion. Thus they create a situation in which the regime is confounded, invariably causing panic…”This manner of striking at the main vulnerability of the post-totalitarian ideological system is a peculiar form of opposition: it doesn’t take place in the halls of power or in the voting booth or in conspiratorial revolutionary cells or in strikes and street protests, but at “the level of human consciousness and conscience, the existential level… in the fifth column of social consciousness, in the hidden aims of life, in human beings’ repressed longing for dignity and fundamental rights… This power does not participate in any direct struggle for power; rather, it makes its influence felt in the obscure arena of being itself.” But once established there, it can and does contribute, in subtle but definite ways, to such things as “a social movement, a sudden explosion of civil unrest, a sharp conflict inside an apparently monolithic power structure, or simply an irrepressible transformation in the social and intellectual climate” and thereby has powerful political consequences.The Prague Spring itself, Havel says, only superficially was a conflict between groups vying for political power. Looked at more closely, it appears as “the final act and the inevitable consequence of a long drama originally played out chiefly in the theatre of the spirit and the conscience of society” and prompted by a few individuals with no pretensions to political power who simply decided to begin living in the truth. The Prague Spring wasn’t the birth of something promising that was then cut down, but the above-ground blooming of something that continues to spread its mycelia underground.And this is why these post-totalitarian ideological systems are so intolerant of leaks and dissent. Why was Solzhenitsyn hounded out of Russia? For the same reason Ed Snowden was hounded into it: “a desperate attempt to plug up the dreadful wellspring of truth, a truth which might cause incalculable transformations in social consciousness, which in turn might one day produce political debacles unpredictable in their consequences.”But living the truth isn’t just a matter of exposing facts. “It can be any means by which a person or a group revolts against manipulation: anything from a letter by intellectuals to a workers’ strike, from a rock concert to a student demonstration, from refusing to vote in the farcical elections to making an open speech at some official congress, or even a hunger strike, for instance.… every free expression of life indirectly threatens the post-totalitarian system politically, including forms of expression to which, in other social systems, no one would attribute any potential political significance, not to mention explosive power.” There’s a reason why Charter 77 was prompted by the prosecution of a rock-and-roll band.Living in the Truth as a Moral, not Political RevolutionHavel thinks the political scenario he has described is a symptom of a widespread epidemic of ethical pathology. The fact that living-in-a-lie has emerged as a self-perpetuating political system suggests that something has gone badly wrong at the core of society and in the moral centers of the people who make it up. It reveals that we have demoralized ourselves by abandoning our senses of responsibility in order to dissolve our identities in the solvent of mass culture and consumerism.Seen in this light, the political side effects of living in the truth are secondary to its function of allowing us to reclaim our moral agency. Indeed, because the beneficial political effects of living in the truth are so diffuse and difficult to trace, and the consequences of confronting the system in this way are in contrast so personal and visceral and likely, nobody would be likely to make the attempt if there were not this additional imperative.Politics Under Post-TotalitarianismHow can a citizen participate in the political process that governs his or her society? In the post-totalitarian system, the normal way to participate is by living in and helping to enforce the lie that perpetuates the stranglehold of the system over the lives of its subjects. Parts of this lie are the farcical processes—voting or pleading with representatives and so forth—that mimic (and, according to the lie, constitute) political deliberation and action. The only form of participation permitted to you is one that helps you propel the system that smothers politics, not one that actually allows you to make decisions together with your fellow citizens.What if you want more than that: participatory politics of equals, rather than the obedient pseudopolitics of the galley slave? Do you participate in the fake elections more vigorously? lobby your fake representatives more persuasively? These things are hopeless and dangerous and make people cynical: if you don’t see beyond the officially-sanctioned outlets of pseudopolitics, there seems to be no point to politics at all.Living in the truth is the remaining method of political activity—the last alternative to the pseudopolitics that just makes things worse. This can sometimes trip up well-meaning activists, who may overestimate the usefulness of confrontational and bold “political” acts—that is, acts within the permitted pseudopolitical sphere—and thereby bolster the perceived legitimacy of that sphere. This is another way of participating in the lie. Instead, effective activists need to understand that they’re in a new sort of system with new rules, and they need to be imaginative and not try to build within either the pseudopolitical framework or within old-fashioned models of dissent.To foment an opposition, don’t paint a picture of a better set of rulers or a new political party or a constitutional amendment or electoral reform or any of that perennial hogwash. Instead, aim concretely and directly at “the continuing and cruel tension between the complex demands of [the post-totalitarian] system and the aims of life, that is, the elementary need of human beings to live, to a certain extent at least, in harmony with themselves… in a bearable way, not to be humiliated by their superiors and officials, not to be continually watched by the police, to be able to express themselves freely, to find an outlet for their creativity, to enjoy legal security, and so on.”We cannot free ourselves by overthrowing a tyranny and imposing freedom from above the way communism was imposed on us from above; instead we have to strive to become free and then impose our freedom on the government from below.Dissent and OppositionIn a democracy, the opposition is a party currently out of power working through legitimate channels within the system to try to gain or exert power. In a traditional dictatorship, the opposition is those people who are trying to replace the dictatorship with something else.Havel says that Charter 77 is not an opposition in these senses, though some of the signers may have aspirations in this direction. It isn’t a political party with aspirations of gaining political power, and it doesn’t have an alternative system it hopes to install in place of the present state. Nonetheless, “Western journalists” have seized on Charter 77 as an “opposition movement” and the Czech government treats it as an oppositional organization simply because it “manages to avoid total manipulation and… therefore denies the principle that the system has an absolute claim on the individual.”“Opposition” is a tricky word. Once the label gets attached to you, you can expect hassles from the state: you are considered a traitor and can expect treatment ranging from character assassination to outright execution. But it’s also deceptive in that it defines your work not in its own terms or in how it relates to reality, but in terms of the system of lies you’re trying to escape: rather than living in the truth you find yourself defined as living in opposition to the lie, and in a way that becomes contaminated with the lie (sources say these protesters oppose the workers of the world uniting).Some people who are trying to live in the truth in the Soviet bloc were called “dissidents”—something Havel belittles as a sort of Western media-granted celebrity status (he always puts the word in quotation marks).One danger of this label is that it comes to sound like a profession—like you have to have a license to dissent, or like it’s only for people who have made it their special vocation. In fact, “dissidents” are not people who “consciously decided to be professional malcontents” but ordinary people “who are doing what they feel they must and, consequently, who find themselves in open conflict with the regime.”The label has a way of separating a small group of people into an elevated clique and treating them like a tiny interest group distinct from society at large: journalists ask “is the government going to respect the rights of the dissidents” rather than “is the government going to respect everyone’s right to live in the truth?”It is truly a cruel paradox that the more some citizens stand up in defense of other citizens, the more they are labeled with a word that in effect separates them from those “other citizens.”Small-Scale WorkWhat of the argument that it’s worth making small concessions to the lie in order to be granted the limited freedom and resources necessary to do good work? Why not work within the system and try to make it better or to ameliorate its problems?There’s something to this: “It is hard to say how much worse things would be if there were not many hard-working people who simply refuse to give up and try constantly to do the best they can, paying an unavoidable minimum to living within a lie so that they might give their utmost to the authentic needs of society. These people assume, correctly, that every piece of good work is an indirect criticism of bad politics, and that there are situations where it is worthwhile going this route, even though it means surrendering one’s natural right to make direct criticisms.”But Havel says that this option has become less tenable in Czechoslovakia. Things have become too rotten. The compromises are too overwhelming. Too much good work ends up being hijacked and parasitized to feed the corrupting engine of the system. When the system requires total adherence to an ideology that has become totally unmoored from the truth, how much good can you do without butting up against the ideology’s limits? If you decide to stay safe, you lose your ability to do good; if you decide to keep doing good, you find yourself suddenly a “dissident” in spite of your modest intentions.But this is not one-size-fits-all advice. If you find that in your situation you can do the most good by making tactical concessions to the lie, Havel advises that you make your judgment call and do what you can. It is possible to live honorably this way. If you do the right thing and find out that (surprise!) it’s also permitted—that’s a marvelous discovery.Living in the truth is not necessarily overtly oppositional or dissenting at all. Some of it is subtle and not particularly visible—“you simply straighten your backbone and live in greater dignity as an individual.” Other parts are more visible and shared: “everything from self-education and thinking about the world, through free creative activity and its communication to others, to the most varied free, civic attitudes, including instances of independent social self-organization.” When there is enough of this going on, it forms the soil in which more overtly and consciously political initiatives can grow.A movement of “dissent” requires a healthy substrate of independent, grassroots social activity and organization; this in turn depends on individuals willing to seed such independent ways of living by living in the truth as individuals even in the absence of this social support structure.But remember those quotation marks around “dissent”—it’s not so much that self-consciously dissident groups are going to emerge from this strata of independent ways of living, but that some of these independent ways of living are going to be persecuted by an intolerant government and will thereby become dissident activities.People and PoliticsThe “dissident” movements in the Soviet bloc, Havel says, are defensive: that is, they are defending human beings against a smothering anti-human system. He contrasts this with political movements, which may have an offensive as well as defensive program, for instance a program to institute a different sort of system or to reform the existing one in a particular way.Havel thinks this is not a liability but an advantage: “it forces politics to return to its only proper starting point… individual people.” He thinks that things have gotten so bad in his country that the central issue isn’t about what shape the political system ought to take but about what to do for the people who are victimized by the political system. In contrast: “In the democratic societies, where the violence done to human beings is not nearly so obvious and cruel, this fundamental revolution in politics has yet to happen, and some things will probably have to get worse there before the urgent need for that revolution is reflected in politics.”Every society, of course, requires some degree of organization. Yet if that organization is to serve people, and not the other way around, then people will have to be liberated and space created so that they may organize themselves in meaningful ways. The depravity of the opposite approach, in which people are first organized in one way or another (by someone who always knows best “what the people need”) so they may then allegedly be liberated, is something we have known on our own skins only too well.Revolt and LawMaybe it’s time to revolt, to overthrow the system entirely and to install a new one by force. But such a revolt is difficult to imagine in the post-totalitarian system. Such a revolt would involve two opposed forces of roughly equivalent strength meeting in the arena of actual force and political power. But in the post-totalitarian system:Society is not sharply polarized on the level of actual political power, but, as we have seen, the fundamental lines of conflict run right through each person. In this situation, no attempt at revolt could ever hope to set up even a minimum of resonance in the rest of society, because that society is soporific, submerged in a consumer rat race and wholly involved in the post-totalitarian system (that is, participating in it and acting as agents of its automatism), and it would simply find anything like revolt unacceptable. It would interpret the revolt as an attack upon itself and, rather than supporting the revolt, it would very probably react by intensifying its bias toward the system, since, in its view, the system can at least guarantee a certain quasi-legality. Add to this the fact that the post-totalitarian system has at its disposal a complex mechanism of direct and indirect surveillance that has no equal in history and it is clear that not only would any attempt to revolt come to a dead end politically, but it would also be almost technically impossible to carry off. Most probably it would be liquidated before it had a chance to translate its intentions into action. Even if revolt were possible, however, it would remain the solitary gesture of a few isolated individuals and they would be opposed not only by a gigantic apparatus of national (and supranational) power, but also by the very society in whose name they were mounting their revolt in the first place. (This, by the way, is another reason why the regime and its propaganda have been ascribing terroristic aims to the “dissident” movements and accusing them of illegal and conspiratorial methods.)“Dissident” movements tend to have a strong bias against violent change, though not one that veers dogmatically into pacifism:“[D]issidents” tend to be skeptical about political thought based on the faith that profound social changes can only be achieved by bringing about (regardless of the method) changes in the system or in the government, and the belief that such changes—because they are considered “fundamental”—justify the sacrifice of “less fundamental” things, in other words, human lives.The “dissident” view is that you don’t change the system first, but that the system will change incidentally as changes take place in the people who uphold and evolve the system. They “do not shy away from the idea of violent political overthrow because the idea seems too radical, but on the contrary, because it does not seem radical enough.”Thus an attitude that turns away from abstract political visions of the future toward concrete human beings and ways of defending them effectively in the here and now is quite naturally accompanied by an intensified antipathy to all forms of violence carried out in the name of a better future, and by a profound belief that a future secured by violence might actually be worse than what exists now; in other words, the future would be fatally stigmatized by the very means used to secure it.Havel notes that many of the “dissident” groups, like the Charter 77 movement, claim to be acting in the defense of various doctrines of international or national law—“such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights, the Concluding Act of the Helsinki Agreement, and the constitutions of individual states.” Why might this be? After all, it is completely naïve to think that their governments actually respect these laws, have any interest in respecting them, or can be compelled by some greater force to respect them. Is pretending that the law is meaningful just another way of living in the lie?Havel defends this legalistic approach, at least as it applies to the post-totalitarian system.Such a system is not dominated by power-wielding groups or individuals, the way a traditional totalitarian system is, but by bureaucracy and ideology. It “is utterly obsessed with the need to bind everything in a single order: life in such a state is thoroughly permeated by a dense network of regulations, proclamations, directives, norms, orders, and rules.” The legal code is one expression of the ideology underlying the system, and of one of the lies of the system: that it is well-regulated, governed by law, eager for justice, and vigorous in its defense of human rights.If an outside observer who knew nothing at all about life in Czechoslovakia were to study only its laws, he would be utterly incapable of understanding what we were complaining about. The hidden political manipulation of the courts and of public prosecutors, the limitations placed on lawyers’ ability to defend their clients, the closed nature, de facto, of trials, the arbitrary actions of the security forces, their position of authority over the judiciary, the absurdly broad application of several deliberately vague sections of that code, and of course the state’s utter disregard for the positive sections of that code (the rights of citizens): all of this would remain hidden from our outside observer.…But that is not all: if our observer had the opportunity to study the formal side of the policing and judicial procedures and practices, how they look “on paper,” he would discover that for the most part the common rules of criminal procedure are observed: charges are laid within the prescribed period following arrest, and it is the same with detention orders. Indictments are properly delivered, the accused has a lawyer, and so on. In other words, everyone has an excuse: they have all observed the law.The legal code is also the mechanism by which the various parts of the system communicate with each other and establish their roles and duties. It’s a sort of scaffolding. “It provides their whole game with its rules and engineers with their technology.… Without the legal code functioning as a ritually cohesive force, the post-totalitarian system could not exist.”So this is the reasoning behind the legalistic approach. There’s no need to pretend that the law is anything but what it is, but that doesn’t mean that the law cannot be used to advantage. The system depends on it and, to some extent anyway, must flow through the channels it defines in order to function.I have frequently witnessed policemen, prosecutors, or judges—if they were dealing with an experienced Chartist [(Charter-signer)] or a courageous lawyer, and if they were exposed to public attention (as individuals with a name, no longer protected by the anonymity of the apparatus)—suddenly and anxiously begin to take particular care that no cracks appear in the ritual. This does not alter the fact that a despotic power is hiding behind that ritual, but the very existence of the officials’ anxiety necessarily regulates, limits, and slows down the operation of that despotism.Building Parallel StructuresThere’s another choice besides revolt and legalism. Rather than try to overthrow the current system or turn its rulebook against it, you can extend your participation in ways of life that substitute for the system’s.In a way this naturally follows from the independent ways of living mentioned earlier. As more people live in the truth and develop these independent ways of living, they will come to do so together, interacting and creating new ways of organizing and structuring these independent activities. New organizations and structures will fill spaces that the State has left unfilled or that it fails to monopolize. Some examples of this in Czechoslovakia were the underground music scene and the samizdat publishing and distribution industry, but the form had potential to extend further, into such things as “parallel forms of education (private universities), parallel trade unions, parallel foreign contacts, to a kind of hypothesis on a parallel economy” and eventually a parallel state (Havel attributes these ideas to Václav Benda).This approach is people-centered, it’s not just aimed at some future benefit but is beneficial in the here-and-now, it’s practical and not just theoretical, it’s something everyone can participate in, and it’s radical in the sense that it works directly at the root of people’s day-to-day lives rather than in the superstructure of the system.Because people who decide to live in the truth are, at first anyway, isolated rebels distinct from society, there is a temptation to see them as individualists in retreat from society: outcast or in isolation (the title “dissident” is another way of emphasizing this point of view). It is more accurate to see them not as retreating from society but advancing before it: as experimental pathfinders beating new trails and inviting society to follow their lead. Similarly, when groups of people develop parallel structures that substitute for those sanctioned by the system, this is not an act of monastic retreat or ghettoization but one of experimental advance.So be careful not to see this parallel world as an end in itself, as though once we get it established we will be able to migrate there and leave the other world behind. So long as the post-totalitarian system rules, our participation in the parallel world will be tainted by the same schizophrenia that everyone suffers: trying to live with partial respect for the truth and partial subservience to the lie. The point is not to establish an underground in which you can enjoy furtive moments of freedom, but to free everyone (a sort of “mahāyāna” agorism perhaps).The system will react to these parallel structures in two ways: by trying to repress them and by trying to coopt them. The repression is straightforward: practices will be banned, practitioners persecuted. Cooptation is a little more subtle. The system may adopt those aspects of the parallel world that are especially popular or effective or difficult to control. This may be a positive thing, something of a real reform, but it often is just a way of rendering the parallel world safe to the system—defanging it, integrating it into the lie, and slapping a patina of progress and liberality onto the system’s façade. It can be confusing, if not deliberately baffling.But the cooptation works both ways, and it will be through such grudging attempts at compromise that the post-totalitarian system will eventually be defeated. It is not the case either that all of these attempts at cooptation are bad and should be resisted or that all of them are good and should be encouraged. Is your attempt at a parallel structure partially contaminated by the ruling system? Of course it is. Don’t let this discourage you; don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Keep your eyes on the truth and keep moving forward in the direction it points.The post-totalitarian system and the parallel system of people developing ways of living in the truth together are two incompatible worlds, and one of them must go: “either the post-totalitarian system will go on developing… thus inevitably coming closer to some dreadful Orwellian vision of a world of absolute manipulation, while all the more articulate expressions of living within the truth are definitely snuffed out; or the independent life of society (the parallel polis), including the ‘dissident’ movements, will slowly but surely become a social phenomenon of growing importance, taking a real part in the life of society with increasing clarity and influencing the general situation.”What will prompt the coup de grâce is impossible to predict. It will probably be some accident of history or the culmination of trends that are only clear in retrospect. Our task is not to plot this revolution but to lay the groundwork that makes it possible or inevitable.The Crisis of Contemporary Technological SocietyThe problem we’re faced with is deeper than the specific post-totalitarian system in the Soviet bloc, and will not end when it does:Technology—that child of modern science, which in turn is a child of modern metaphysics—is out of humanity’s control, has ceased to serve us, has enslaved us and compelled us to participate in the preparation of our own destruction. And humanity can find no way out: we have no idea and no faith, and even less do we have a political conception to help us bring things back under human control. We look on helplessly as that coldly functioning machine we have created inevitably engulfs us, tearing us away from our natural affiliations (for instance, from our habitat in the widest sense of that word, including our habitat in the biosphere) just as it removes us from the experience of Being and casts us into the world of “existences.”Here, too, we need a revolution, but it must be more fundamental, not “merely philosophical, merely social, merely technological, or even merely political” but existential, “a generally ethical—and, of course, ultimately a political—reconstitution of society.”The post-totalitarian system is only one aspect—a particularly drastic aspect and thus all the more revealing of its real origins—of this general inability of modern humanity to be the master of its own situation. The automatism of the post-totalitarian system is merely an extreme version of the global automatism of technological civilization. The human failure that it mirrors is only one variant of the general failure of modern humanity.Western liberal democracy—that famous “end of history”—is not an adequate response to this crisis. “It may even be said that the more room there is in the Western democracies (compared to our world) for the genuine aims of life, the better the crisis is hidden from people and the more deeply do they become immersed in it.…”People are manipulated in ways that are infinitely more subtle and refined than the brutal methods used in the post-totalitarian societies. But this static complex of rigid, conceptually sloppy, and politically pragmatic mass political parties run by professional apparatuses and releasing the citizen from all forms of concrete and personal responsibility; and those complex focuses of capital accumulation engaged in secret manipulations and expansion; the omnipresent dictatorship of consumption, production, advertising, commerce, consumer culture, and all that flood of information: all of it, so often analyzed and described, can only with great difficulty be imagined as the source of humanity’s rediscovery of itself.… In a democracy, human beings may enjoy many personal freedoms and securities that are unknown to us, but in the end they do them no good, for they too are ultimately victims of the same automatism, and are incapable of defending their concerns about their own identity or preventing their superficialization or transcending concerns about their own personal survival to become proud and responsible members of the polis, making a genuine contribution to the creation of its destiny.For this reason, it would be short-sighted for post-totalitarian dissidents to set their sights on establishing a democracy of this sort as anything but a temporary stepping stone to a society of dignity. Confronted with a “post-totalitarian” situation, we need a “post-democratic” solution.What Is to Be Done?What we really need is a reconstitution of the larger human order of which the political order is just a part. And this means a society-wide moral revolution of such things as “[a] new experience of being, a renewed rootedness in the universe, a newly grasped sense of higher responsibility, a newfound inner relationship to other people and to the human community.… In other words, the issue is the rehabilitation of values like trust, openness, responsibility, solidarity, love.”The political reformation will follow naturally from this. It is hazardous to try to predict in advance what it will look like, but there are some aspects that we might anticipate: It will probably rely more on smaller units of organization that are based on natural communities of people with shared interests (rather than big states with arbitrary geographical boundaries). These units of organization will not have monopolistic impulses but will be welcoming of new and of parallel structures. They will be less formal—not like organizations but like communities. Their authority will be based on their utility, not on sovereignty. They will be more likely to spring up ad-hoc as needed rather than being on-going institutions. Individuals who have authority will not have it by virtue of their title or position, but because of the trust they have earned in taking responsibility for the specific tasks at issue. This may mean that they have more political power than the politicians today.And this goes for economic organization as well as political organization: Self-managed, purposeful units—not autonomous, self-interested corporations with subservient workers who have no stake in or responsibility for their work.And come to think of it… these little clusters of people living in the truth, finding each other, forming human bonds of solidarity by desperate necessity, creating experiments in parallel structures based on concrete human needs—aren’t they demonstrations of the sort of world we’re trying to feel our way toward?',\n",

In all cases, approximately the same posts showed up at the top of the rankings, albeit in somewhat different orders. I\\'m excited to reward all of them prizes for contributing to important intellectual progress.\\xa0Two things \\xa0stuck out between the various rankings:\\xa0In the Alignment Forum vote, Draft Report on AI Timelines won by a landslide.\\xa0In the \"All Users\" vote, the MicroCOVID.org announcement won by a landslide.\\xa0Thoughts on the microCOVID.org AnnouncementSeveral people asked, upon seeing microCOVID.org in the review: \"Is this what the Review is meant to reward? It sure was useful, but was it \\'intellectual progress\\'? Was it \\'timeless\\'? What would it mean to put it in a book?\"We haven\\'t yet made our final call on whether/how to do books this year, but if I were to print microCOVID, I\\'d specifically be interested in printing the whitepaper. Unlike the announcement (which would be quite weird to read in a book), the whitepaper is clearly a piece of enduring intellectual labor.I actually took some pretty timeless, valuable lessons from microCOVID – the schema that you can break \"risk\" into units that linearly add up was helpful for my overall thinking, and I expect to be relevant in other domains. And the conceptual breakdown of splitting up \"person risk\" and \"activity risk\" was useful.\\xa0I think microCOVID was a great instance of applied rationality that built off a lot of concepts in our \\xa0ecosystem, and translated them into a concrete product.\\xa0Thoughts on Draft Report on AI TimelinesAjeya\\'s Draft Report on AI Timelines inspired a ton of discussion: Eliezer wrote a response post, and Holden wrote a counter-response, and there was further discussion on each post. I plan to include both follow-up posts as contextual reviews in the Best of 2020 sequences and/or books.Daniel Kokotajlo wrote this review articulating why the post seemed important to him (edited slightly for brevity):Whenever people ask me for my views on timelines, I go through the following mini-flowchart:1. Have you read Ajeya\\'s report?– If yes, launch into a conversation about the distribution over 2020\\'s training compute and explain why I think the distribution should be substantially to the left, why I worry it might shift leftward faster than she projects, and why I think we should use it to forecast AI-PONR instead of TAI.– If no, launch into a conversation about Ajeya\\'s framework and why it\\'s the best and why all discussion of AI timelines should begin there.So, why do I think it\\'s the best? In a nutshell: Ajeya\\'s framework is to AI forecasting what actual climate models are to climate change forecasting (by contrast with lower-tier methods such as \"Just look at the time series of temperature over time / AI performance over time and extrapolate\" and \"Make a list of factors that might push the temperature up or down in the future / make AI progress harder or easier,\" and of course the classic \"poll a bunch of people with vaguely related credentials.\")Ajeya\\'s model makes only a few very plausible assumptions. This is underappreciated, I think. People will say e.g. \"I think data is the bottleneck, not compute.\" But Ajeya\\'s model doesn\\'t assume otherwise! If you think data is the bottleneck, then the model is more difficult for you to use and will give more boring outputs, but you can still use it.\\xa0I think a lot of people are making a mistake when they treat Ajeya\\'s framework as just another model to foxily aggregate over. \"When I think through Ajeya\\'s model, I get X timelines, but then when I extrapolate out GWP trends I get Y timelines, so I\\'m going to go with (X+Y)/2.\" I think instead everyone\\'s timelines should be derived from variations on Ajeya\\'s model, with extensions to account for things deemed important (like data collection progress) and tweaks upwards or downwards to account for the rest of the stuff not modeled.The Unit of Caring prize poolTwelve users donated to the Unit of Caring prize pool. $1375 was donated to thank specific authors, and $395 was donated to the \"general moderator discretion\" fund.

It\\'s also about the process of reflection and evaluation of those posts. We\\'ve been awarding prizes for reviewers who contributed significant commentary on posts. The totals came to:$600 to AllAmericanBreakfast$500 to johnswentworth$400 to Vanessa Kosoy$200 to Steven Byrnes$200 to Zvi$100 each to abramdemski, adamzerner, CharlieSteiner, Daniel Kokotajlo, Davidmanheim, Elizabeth, magfrump, MondSemmel, Neel Nanda, niplav, nostalgebraist, philh, Richard Korzekwa, Turntrout, Vika, Yoav Ravid, and Zack_M_DavisI separately hired Bucky to do some in-depth reviews.There were a few different ways I found reviews valuable.First, often they simply reminded me a good post existed, and gave some context for why it mattered. (johnswentworth\\'s comments on Subspace Optima were a short and sweet version of this. Daniel Kokotajlo\\'s comments on 11 Proposals for Safe Advanced AI were also a great example, which I expect fed into that post ranking highly in the overall vote)Second, there were many self-reviews by authors who had learned a lot. Of these, some of my favorites are:Steve Byrnes on Inner Alignment in Salt Starved Rats, where he exhaustively goes over some updates he made to his model.Niplav\\'s self-review of Range and Forecasting Accuracy (he expressed worry about a number of mistakes in the post, but I think the review is a great time to fix mistakes on otherwise good posts, and I was generally quite impressed with his thoroughness and thought the topic was quite important).Third, critical reviews.I thought TurnTrout\\'s comment on Nuclear War Is Unlike to Cause Human Extinction was succinct, and helped draw attention to a missing piece of the story. Landfish responded with some clarification.Bucky\\'s commentary on Kelly Bet On Everything helped iron out where the math exactly worked.AllAmericanBreakfast dug into the paper Scott cites in Studies on Slack, which taught me some new empirical things about the world as well as feeding into a comprehensive critique.Fourth, in-depth reviews that explored an idea and thought about its applications.Johnswentworth and Vanessa both had good reviews of The Solomonoff Prior is Malign, which is a concept I\\'ve found confusing to think about.My sense is that reviewing generally feels less glamorous than writing top level posts, but I think it\\'s quite important for grounding the overall process.\\xa0To all our reviewers, thank you!One More Thing...That\\'s almost it for this year\\'s review. We have at least one additional bit of work, which is assembling the top posts into sequences. The winning posts will be integrated into our site library, promoted heavily for new users to read and reflect on.Congratulations to the winning authors – thank you for contributing to LessWrong\\'s longterm intellectual progress. \\xa0\\xa0^During the Review Phase, people were encouraged to write comments reviewing each nominated post, reflecting on why it was valuable or how it could be improved.\\xa0',\n",

       " {'text': 'Several years ago I gushed and gushed about Alasdair MacIntyre’s book After Virtue. I’m not taking any of that gushing back today—I still think it was an exciting argument and one that has continued to resonate with me.But I finally got around to reading G.E.M. Ans\\xadcombe’s essay “Mod\\xadern Mor\\xadal Phil\\xados\\xado\\xadphy,” which pre\\xaddates Mac\\xadIntyre’s book by two dec\\xadades, and I found that she had al\\xadready put for\\xadward much of the core of Mac\\xadIntyre’s later ar\\xadgu\\xadment there. Mac\\xadIntyre only men\\xadtions Ans\\xadcombe’s es\\xadsay in a brief paren\\xadthe\\xadti\\xadcal in his book (in which he says that parts of his own ar\\xadgu\\xadment are “both deeply in\\xaddebted to and rather dif\\xadfer\\xadent from that of Ans\\xadcombe 1958”). To me it feels more like Mac\\xadIntyre fur\\xadther elabo\\xadra\\xadted a pro\\xadject and a the\\xado\\xadre\\xadti\\xadcal frame\\xadwork that Ans\\xadcombe de\\xadserves credit for estab\\xadlish\\xading.I’ll try to summarize her 26-page argument in sixteen paragraphs, in the hopes of whetting your appetite for reading the whole thing:Anscombe argues that concepts like “moral obligation,” “morally right and wrong,” and “the moral sense of ‘ought’\\u202f” have lost their meaning. Such phrases “ought to be jettisoned” by philosophers “because they are survivals, or derivatives from survivals, from an earlier conception of ethics which no longer generally survives” and so are now just confusing. (This is not because she is a moral nihilist—she’s about as far from that as you can get—but because she thinks philosophy has become hopelessly confused and needs to reset.)She traces the term “moral” to Aristotle (if I remember right, Aristotle used ἠθικός which got translated into moralis in Latin). But because of how the meaning of “moral” has shifted over time, to read Aristotle in translation today means to “constantly feel like someone whose jaws have somehow got out of alignment: the teeth don’t come together in a proper bite.”Words like “should”/“ought”/“needs” are used in two senses: First, to describe the requirements for things with purposes (this machinery needs oil, ought to be oiled, in order to function as it should); secondly, in the modern moral sense to indicate obligation. This second sense has a historical pedigree. Anscombe believes it resulted from the Judeo-Christian belief in divine law. Christianity borrowed terms from Greek philosophy and put a divine law spin on them, so that, for example, the Greek word for going astray or being mistaken (ἀμαρτάνειν) became the word for sinning: breaking the divine law.When Christianity changed the meanings of concepts like sin and virtue in this way, moral terms like “should” and “ought” became appropriate to those concepts (that you should or ought to obey the divine law is just inherent to what divine law is). But over time moral philosophy shed divine law but tried to keep the virtues. In doing so, it found that this foundation had been pulled out from under them. If moderns continue to talk about virtues in terms of “should” and “ought” without the Christian appendages that those terms could successfully attach to, they’re talking empty nonsense. Anscombe calls this “the survival of a concept outside the framework of thought that made it a really intelligible one” that has had the effect of rendering “[the] word ‘ought’… a word of mere mesmeric force.… a word retaining the suggestion of force, and apt to have a strong psychological effect, but which no longer signifies a real concept at all.”European ethical philosophers of note have tied themselves in knots trying to make sense of this modern moral ought. Butler put “conscience” first, “but appears ignorant that a man’s conscience may tell him to do the vilest things.” Hume\\u2009was\\u2009“a mere—brilliant—sophist”\\u2009who removed ethical judgments from the category of things that can be true. Kant established the “absurd” idea of “legislating for oneself” and took it to uselessly rigid conclusions. Bentham and Mill (whose utilitarianism was “stupid”) got lost in a thicket of “pleasure” as an end, though not because of a supposed “naturalistic fallacy” about which Anscombe “do[es] not find accounts of it coherent.”Sidgwick and Moore are what Anscombe calls consequentialists—using a term that is now standard, but that she herself coined for this essay. She means the term to describe someone who reasons more or less like a utilitarian but without necessarily specifying “utility” as the criterion—someone who believes that we are acting ethically if and only if we are acting to optimize some quality or other of the future state of the world.Sidgwick in particular advanced a theory of responsibility that Anscombe says was particularly seductive and harmful. In brief, that theory is this: “it does not make any difference to a man’s responsibility for an effect of his action which he can foresee, that he does not intend” that effect. There is something to this idea, which is what makes it so seductive, but left as-is and not examined further it can have terrible consequences. The terrible consequences in this case turned out to include consequentialism.If you blindly follow Sidgwick’s idea to its logical conclusions, those conclusions are of the ends-justify-the-means variety: It is justified to do the most shameful awful vile thing, if an unintended but foreseeable hypothetical consequence of not doing it is sufficiently bad. Furthermore, “you can exculpate yourself from the actual consequences of the most disgraceful actions, so long as you can make out a case for having not foreseen them.”(Anscombe suggests a more sensible formula wold be this: “[A] man is responsible for the bad consequences of his bad actions, but gets no credit for the good ones; and contrariwise is not responsible for the bad consequences of his good actions.”)By swallowing Sidgwick’s terrible idea whole, says Anscombe, the consequentialists have elevated a moral temptation to the status of a moral philosophy. Furthermore, because their philosophy demands prescience about consequences, but they can’t predict the future any better than the rest of us can, they cannot give us any actual practical ethical advice. Instead, they give us the terminology with which we can better articulate our temptations to do shameful things, and they give us the predisposition to consent to the casuistry of other bad actors.Is there a way to get back to moral oughts, or something like them, without divine law? For example, a plant “needs” water, and so you “ought to” see that the plant gets some if you want the plant to thrive. But that “if” is where the problem lies, because “ought to” in the moral sense is supposed to somehow work without any “if” clause attached. However, to the plant itself there doesn’t seem to be such a problem: it ought to pull in some water through its roots because otherwise it’s obviously doomed, and so pull water it does. Is there some sense in which human beings “need” the virtues in order to thrive in the same sort of way that plants need water, in which case it would not be controversial that the fact of such a need generates (at least a rebuttable presumption of) an ought?Even so, a modern moral philosopher could argue that we’ve just moved the problem rather than resolved it. I need something to thrive, and I presumably ought therefore to pursue it if I want to thrive… there’s that “if” again. (Some philosophers even try to attack divine-law theories on this ground, saying that even if you believe in divine law, its “oughts” have no force to compel action unless you also add “if you want to obey the divine law” to the end of them.)What alternatives remain to the old-fashioned divine law model? One possibility is a sort of natural law: divine law without the divinity. Maybe such a law can be found in “natural religion”, or maybe in the norms of society (though when you see what kinds of norms societies have had, or take a close look at how nature legislates, maybe that’s not such a great idea). Can you come up with laws on your own—legislate “for yourself” in a Kantean (or existentialist?) way? Such things, Anscombe says, aren’t really laws; they’re at best a sort of stand-in for laws. What about contractualism—the idea that moral law reflects an ancient or inevitable or mythical social contract? Anscombe is skeptical, though she says there is room for investigation in some of these paths.Ah, but what about virtue ethics in the Aristotelian vein? Anscombe considers this, and thinks it works, but only if you remember that Aristotle’s ethics predates the Christian change in moral terminology. If you rewind the clock back that far, you go past the modern incoherent and mesmeric moral “ought,” and then continue past the divine law’s commanded moral “ought,” then finally to an ethics in which the moral “ought” no longer makes an appearance. So you aren’t going to solve the problem of making the moral ought make sense that way. But that might be just fine: Anscombe thinks it’s time for philosophers to put that problem on the shelf anyway.But, says Anscombe, we are still a long way from being able to create a robust virtue ethics, as “philosophically there is a huge gap, at present unfillable as far as we are concerned, which needs to be filled by an account of human nature, human action, the type of characteristic a virtue is, and above all of human ‘flourishing.’\\u202f”But that daunting project seems to Anscombe more promising than the project of modern Anglophone moral philosophy circa 1958: to create ethical systems under which no act is too vile for some future hypothetical possibility to justify it.',\n",

       " {'text': 'TL;DR: Ukraine will eventually either get nuclear protection by NATO or its own nukes, which in both cases will likely lead to the nuclear war with Russia. Knowing this, Putin may want to attack first or credibly threaten to do so.The whole world is looking at the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Will it lead to nuclear war?My general view is that the Ukraine-Russia conflict is structurally similar to the conflict between India and Pakistan. There are many differences, but it is a good reference point. Pakistan appeared after the British empire breakdown and it was a relatively new country whose borders was not well established. Kashmir is like Crimea in this conflict.\\xa0\\xa0The bottom line of this analogy is that there will be many wars between Ukraine and Russia and that Ukraine will eventually become a nuclear power, the same way as Pakistan did, or will get similar military capabilities via drones and membership in NATO.\\xa0\\xa0Putin also knows this and also knows that his large tank armies are almost obsolete. Therefore, he tries to limit future Ukraine military capabilities by attacking (or threatening) now. He does actually say this: we see Ukraine (in NATO) as an existential threat. He may also have some other irrational motives but the rational motives go beyond Putin, so any other Russian leader will be in the same strategic situation.A nuclear war between Russia and Ukraine is rather possible from a long-term perspective, no matter how the current escalation will end. Unless the current war ends with the complete occupation of Ukraine. \\xa0Therefore, the real goal of the war may be taking (or permanently damaging) almost all Ukraine including all nuclear power stations and industrial capabilities. Personally, I do not think it will make Russia safer, as new military technologies (drones) will continue to evolve in other countries and Russia will be cut from new tech by enormous sanctions. In my view, the large war with Ukraine will end in large crimes and will be eventually lost because of international help.Therefore, Putin may see the current moment as the only chance to stop future nuclear-protected Ukraine and to prevent a nuclear war with it.Ukraine now is slowly developing medium-range missiles which can reach Moscow according to some accounts. (\\xa0Hrim-2 declared distance is 500 \\xa0km, Poroshenko said 1000 km is possible.)A rocket attack from Ukraine against Moscow, even if with a conventional warhead, will trigger Russian nuclear-powered anti-ballistic missiles. The nuclear explosions of such anti-missiles will be small (15kt?) and high-altitude, so there will be no harm, but it will be the first use of nuclear weapons in conflict for decades. A hypothetical future nuclear war of Russia with Ukraine could spill to other countries, as an attack by Ukraine on Russia could be seen as a hidden US attack.\\xa0Ukraine has a very large civil nuclear power – several stations of the size of Chernobyl (15 reactors). They could be used to produce plutonium. Ukraine has uranium ore mines. In 2019, the construction of nuclear fuel production plant was started (centrifuges?)\\xa0Ukraine non-nuclear status is based on the Budapest memorandum. 19 Feb in Munich Ukrainian president Zelensky almost threatened Ukraine’s rejection of the Budapest Memorandum: “I am initiating consultations in the framework of the Budapest Memorandum. The Minister of Foreign Affairs was commissioned to convene them. If they do not happen again or their results do not guarantee security for our country, Ukraine will have every right to believe that the Budapest Memorandum is not working and all the package decisions of 1994 are in doubt.”The memorandum was signed on December 5, 1994, by the United Kingdom, Russia, the USA and Ukraine and provided guarantees of the security and territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for the renunciation of nuclear weapons. After the annexation of Crimea, the memorandum was clearly violated and Ukraine has “technical” right to demand its nuclear status back, or exchange this right for membership in NATO.\\xa0While NATO is a defence organization, Ukraine hopes that the membership in NATO will help Ukraine to attack Donbas and Crimea, which are its territories according to international laws – without risks of Russian retaliation. This situation will quickly deteriorate to war between NATO and Russia. Actually, nobody wants neither nuclear Ukraine, nor Ukraine in NATO, so NATO continues to feed Ukraine with promises without exact substance. \\xa0Ukraine unlikely will openly start to work on nukes soon, but it can ask for equal weapons in exchange for not doing so.\\xa0Therefore, for Putin, it is like a trolley problem: bad war now or hypothetical very bad war in the future. Personally, I am against changing the track in the trolley problem, as it is killing the real people for the possible safety of hypothetical people. Possible people and risks are more likely to be products of imagination and therefore many trolley-like problems are subject to biases – or just good words to cover some bad intentions.\\xa0In December 2021 Putin put a rather broad ultimatum to NATO: either provide safety guarantees to Russia or deal with military-technical consequences.\\xa0The wars are known to be unpredictable, so there is a risk that the current confrontation will spiral out of control into a global nuclear war. I even thought about moving to a county house from Moscow but decided to stay for now.In some sense, it is a game of chicken on the trolley track.',\n",

       " {'text': 'In this post I\\'d like to construct an extension to the Sleeping Beauty problem which is unsolvable from an thirder/SIA perspective. The core of the construction is having the number of wakings Beauty will experience follow a distribution with an infinite mean. This leads to Beauty being unable to assign normalized probability values when reasoning under SIA. Given this forum\\'s fascination with anthropic reasoning and this problem, this may be of interest.The original Sleeping Beauty problemThe following is a summary of the thirder/SIA approach to the original Sleeping Beauty problem. From what I can tell, this forum is very well versed here, so I won\\'t go into too much background detail.In the original problem, we have the following two steps for the experimenter:Flip a coin. If heads, record the value\\xa0N=0. If tails, record the value\\xa0N=1.Put Beauty to sleep [on Sunday]. She will be woken once on each of the following\\xa0N+1\\xa0days, with memory erased between wakings. (i.e. once if heads, twice if tails)Let\\xa0Mk\\xa0be the proposition \"I am awake and today is the\\xa0kth day since the experiment began\". (I.e.\\xa0M1\\xa0is \"I am awake and it is Monday\";\\xa0M2\\xa0is \"I am awake and it is Tuesday\".) Also let\\xa0M\\xa0be the proposition \"I am awake\", in the sense that\\xa0M=M1∨M2.The problem is then to give Beauty a value to assign to the conditional probability of heads given that she has been awoken, i.e. toP(N=0∣M).One version of the thirder/SIA calculation for this value then proceeds as follows.P(N=0∣M)P(N=1∣M)=P(M∣N=0)P(M∣N=1)P(N=0)P(N=1)=P(M1∣N=0)+P(M2∣N=0)P(M1∣N=1)+P(M2∣N=1)P(N=0)P(N=1)=P(M1∣N=0)+02∗P(M1∣N=1)P(N=0)P(N=1)=12P(N=0∣M1)P(N=1∣M1)=121/21/2=12.Where the steps are respectively due to:Bayes\\' law.That\\xa0M=M1∨M2\\xa0and that\\xa0M1,\\xa0M2\\xa0are disjoint propositions.For the numerator, that\\xa0M2\\xa0is impossible given\\xa0N=0\\xa0(i.e. we cannot wake up on Tuesday if the coin came up heads). For the denominator, this is the part of the SIA assumption: given that the coin came up tails, and we cannot distinguish a waking on Monday or Tuesday, we must put equal weight on both possibilities.Bayes\\' law.Following SIA/thirder reasoning, we put equal weight on heads or tails given that we are waking on Monday. I leave the subtler point of justifying this assignment to the many expositions of thirder/SIA reasoning.Combining this determined ratio with the fact that\\xa0P(N=0∣M)+P(N=1∣M)=1, we must have\\xa0P(N=0∣M)=1/3. This of course is what gives proponents of the above calculation the name \"thirders\".A new construction: Exponentially-Sleeping Beauty problemNow suppose we extend the experiment as follows. The experimenter will:Sample an integer\\xa0N≥0\\xa0according to the distribution\\xa0P0(N=k)=1/2k+1\\xa0for\\xa0k≥0. Perhaps the experimenter implements this by flipping a coin until the first time it comes up tails, and then recording the number of heads.Wake up Beauty\\xa02N\\xa0times.Once again, let\\xa0M\\xa0be the proposition \"I am awake\" and\\xa0Mk\\xa0be the proposition \"I am awake and today is the\\xa0kth day/waking-time since the start of the experiment\". What value should a waking Beauty now assign to e.g. the probability\\xa0P(N=5∣M)?\\xa0We will see that in this new problem, assigning such a value will be problematic. Following the thirder/SIA approach to the original problem, we calculate the ratioP(N=k1∣M)P(N=k2∣M)=P(M∣N=k1)P(M∣N=k2)P(N=k1)P(N=k2)=⎛⎜⎝∑i=2k1i=1P(Mi∣N=k1)∑i=2k2i=1P(Mi∣N=k2)⎞⎟⎠P(N=k1)P(N=k2)=2k12k2P(M1∣N=k1)P(M1∣N=k2)P(N=k1)P(N=k2)=2k1−k2P(N=k1∣M1)P(N=k2∣M1)P(M1)P(M1)=2k1−k21/2k1+11/2k2+1=1.Where the steps are resp. due to:Bayes\\' law/defn. of conditional probabilityWe have\\xa0M=(M1∨M2∨…)\\xa0and \\xa0P(M2k+1∨M2k+2∨⋯∣N=k)=0, so that\\xa0P(M∣N=k)=P(M1∨M2∨…M2k∣N=k). These are mutually exclusive/disjoint propositions, so we can transform into a sum.Following thirder/SIA reasoning, given that\\xa0N=k\\xa0for some\\xa0k, we must assign equal probability for each of the possible days that we can awake, i.e.\\xa0P(Mi∣N=k)=P(M1∣N=k)\\xa0for all\\xa01≤i≤2k.(Bayes\\' law.)Following thirder/SIA reasoning, given only that it is \"Monday\", awoken Beauty\\'s conditional probability on the outcome of the experimenter\\'s coin tosses is the same as what is was before she went to sleep.Hence we have shown that following thirder/SIA reasoning, exponentially-sleeping Beauty must assign\\xa0the probability value ratio\\xa0P(N=k1∣M)P(N=k2∣M)=1\\xa0for every\\xa00≤k1,k2\\xa0pair, hence\\xa0P(N=k∣M)=P(N=0∣M)\\xa0for all\\xa0k≥0.This is a problem. We have an infinite collection of mutually-exclusive probabilities\\xa0{P(N=k∣M)}k≥0\\xa0which we have proven under SIA reasoning to all be of equal value. It is impossible to satisfy this while having our probabilities sum to unity as in\\xa0∑∞k=0P(N=k∣M)=1.Wat does dis mean; how should Beauty assign probabilities here; is this a problem for the SIA?NotesThis construction requires a universe which is infinite in either time or space, in order to have the volume to support a potentially unlimited number of Beauty awakenings.

I had a busier life. I didn’t value spending my attention on books. It wasn’t until 3 years ago that my life settled down. With new found time, my mind’s hunger for novel information increased and I stumbled upon our local library. Fortunately for me, they provide access to two audio book apps (Hoopla and Libby). I also picked up more physical books. My consumption is roughly 75% audio and 25% physical. With the ability to increase playback speed in the apps and my commute, I am able to get through 1-2 books per week. I am not a fast reader, but do purchase physical books worthy of reading or referencing again.As I learn, I find myself wanting to share new concepts with others. These ideas often update my mental models and have increased the resolution of my “map of the territory”. Throughout my journey, intermixed with the phenomenal books below have been less impressive books. The goal of this list is to provide a guide for those searching. I will try and update this periodically. If you have recommendations for additions, please comment below.I put the topics and rankings in order of importance, but read what interest you most.

       " {'text': 'IntroductionHere\\'s a question I\\'ve been pondering recently: how many organic compounds are there? There are multiple ways to interpret the question, each of which leads to consideration of a different potential set of compounds, and each of which is informative in its own way.First off, what is an organic compound? \\xa0This sounds straightforward, but because of the history of the term, it isn\\'t. \\xa0Originally, \"organic compounds\" were carbon-containing compounds associated with living things. \\xa0Over time, the term drifted to include most carbon-containing compounds, except for things like carbon dioxide, minerals like limestone (CaCO3), and allotropes of pure carbon (like diamonds, graphite, or carbon nanotubes). \\xa0Wikipedia defines an organic compound as \"generally any chemical compounds that contain carbon-hydrogen bonds\". \\xa0That definition seems good enough \\xa0for our purposes[1], so we\\'ll go with it.Next, what do we mean by \"are there\"? \\xa0Is it substances that have actually been found or made and characterized? \\xa0A quick check of PubChem says that there are around 100 million (108) compounds with information submitted. \\xa0However, that\\'s not quite what I was envisioning when I asked the question. \\xa0The compounds we\\'ve actually made or isolated (and more importantly, characterized to a greater or lesser extent) are only a tiny fraction of chemical space, which I will loosely define as the set of all possible[2]\\xa0molecules. \\xa0Example Chemical Sub-spaces: Hydrocarbons and ProteinsOrganic chemical space contains, in theory, an infinite number of molecules. \\xa0Consider the set of fully-saturated, unbranched hydrocarbon chains: methane with a single carbon, ethane with two, etc. \\xa0In principle, one could construct an arbitrarily long chain with no reason to expect chemical instability. \\xa0In practice, we make polyethylene chains up to about half a million carbon atoms in length that are reasonable approximations of that thought exercise.Of course, ultra-long hydrocarbons aren\\'t that interesting chemically, with only one monomer and no functional groups. \\xa0What about molecules that actually do things? \\xa0Let\\'s take proteins, a strong contender for \"most interesting class of molecules\". \\xa0There are 20 naturally-occurring amino acids. \\xa0A 30-kDa protein[3]\\xa0has about 300 amino acids, so there are 20^300 (about 10^390) possible combinations of amino acids leading to a protein of moderate size. \\xa0As a comparison, a quick Fermi calculation gives 10^80 atoms in the known universe.[4]\"Smallish\" Organic MoleculesOkay, but that still isn\\'t quite what I meant to ask when I wondered \"how many organic molecules are there?\" \\xa0I\\'m a synthetic organic chemist, so what I really wondered was \"how big is the space of the kinds of molecules that synthetic organic chemists are typically concerned with?\" \\xa0These molecules tend to be:Relatively small compared to the examples we\\'ve considered so far (mostly less than 500 Da molecular weight)Stable on a timescale of at least hours under conditions achievable in the labComposed of relatively dense arrangements of rings, chains, and functional groupsThese constraints are fairly similar to the space of \"potentially pharmacologically active molecules\". \\xa0Wikipedia led me to a paper by Bohacek, McMartin, and Guida[5]\\xa0that gives an estimate of 10^63 such molecules. \\xa0This sounds like an answer to the question I actually wanted to ask, so it\\'s worth unpacking their calculation further.Here\\'s the calculation as Bohacek et al give it[6]:Although the number of possible molecules is difficult to estimate accurately, simple considerations show that it must be very large! Consider growing a linear molecule an atom at a time and choosing a carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom at each position.\\xa0 Some of these atoms can be doubly or triply bonded, but not all combinations of atoms are chemically stable, and some multiple bonds will only be possible in nonlinear structures, i.e., a C=O group. Assuming a very approximate average choice multiplicity of 6, then 6^30 or 2*10^23 molecules could be grown containing 30 atoms. Now consider the ways of introducing branching or cyclization into the resulting structure. Closure of rings with three or more atoms involves selecting two atoms to form a bond and could be achieved in 30*28/2 ways.\\xa0 Making a branched molecule could be achieved by choosing a point to cut the chain and a point in the first part of the chain to attach to the cut end of the second part of the chain (i.e., 30^2 ways). Not all atoms can be joined in this way. However, this will be offset by the fact that when stereochemical considerations are introduced, the number of possibilities will be expanded. Based upon these considerations, approximately 10^40 molecules with up to four rings and 10 branch points could be produced from each linear chain, resulting in a very approximate estimate of 10^63 molecules in total. Although this is a rough estimate, it seems likely that when all the different possible combinations of ring closure and branching are taken into account, the true number will be well in excess of 10^60 and will rise steeply with increasing molecular weight.\\xa0We can quibble with some of the choices made in this calculation, but if anything, the final figure of 10^60 is a lower bound. \\xa0There are other elements besides C, N, O, and S that show up in natural products or other potentially bioactive compounds (B, F, P, Cl, Br, I just for a start) and while the halogens would only substitute for hydrogen, rather than forming rings and chains, each added element contributes multiple orders of magnitude to the total.It\\'s also fun to compare this number with some estimates about how much carbon is available in various places. \\xa0Carbon amounts in this section come from this paper. \\xa0First, there are about 600 Pg carbon in the amosphere, mostly as carbon dioxide. \\xa0That works out to about 3 x 10^40 carbon atoms in Earth\\'s atmosphere.[7]\\xa0 Between the atmosphere, the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere, there are around 43,000 Pg \"circulating carbon\", or ~2 x 10^42 carbon atoms.[8]\\xa0 If we add in the estimates of \"deep carbon\" in the earth\\'s interior, there are around 1.85 x 10^9 Pg C on the planet, or about 10^47 carbon atoms.[9]ConclusionThere are a few points I\\'d like to emphasize at the end of this chain of Fermi calculations. \\xa0First, all the estimates here are incredibly rough, and could be off by multiple orders of magnitude without changing the primary conclusions. \\xa0Second, the set of organic compounds considered as a search space is really big, and if you have a goal that involves picking a compound with a defined set of characteristics, you\\'ll want to do something other than brute-force search. \\xa0Finally, in the estimate for the size of small-molecule chemical space, the bulk of the work (about two-thirds of our log-units) is done by the ability of carbon to form rings and branched chains. \\xa0In this respect, no other element comes close to the variety we see with carbon-based compounds.[10]\\xa0 To the extent that molecular shape is relevant to processes we care about (like living systems we know about, and likely those we haven\\'t encountered yet) we should expect carbon-based compounds to play a significant role.^it does exclude some fun edge cases like carbon tetrachloride and hexafluorobenzene, but any definition we choose will have to draw the line somewhere.^\"Possible\" here is intended to mean only chemical entities that are isolable and stable for at least long enough to be characterized.^That is, a protein with a molecular weight of 30,000 grams per mole. \\xa0Mid-sized, as proteins go.^Wikipedia gives a figure of 1.5x10^53 kg total mass of ordinary matter. \\xa0Most of this is hydrogen atoms, which come 6x10^26 per kilogram. \\xa0That gives 9*10^79 or ~10^80 total atoms. \\xa0The existence of non-hydrogen atoms doesn\\'t change this significantly.^Apologies for the paywalled article. \\xa0I\\'ll quote the portion that interests us in full but wanted to include a link to the paper.^This is far from the main concern of the paper. \\xa0In fact, the calculation is a footnote to a figure late in the paper.^600 Pg carbon = 6 x 10^14 kg C1 kg C = 83.333 mol C = 5 x 10^25 C atoms600 Pg C = 3 x 10^40 C atoms^43,000 Pg carbon = 4.3 x 10^16 kg C1 kg C = 83.333 mol C = 5 x 10^25 C atoms43,000 Pg C = 2 x 10^42 C atoms^1.85 x 10^21 kg C on earth1 kg C = 83.333 mol C = 5 x 10^25 atoms9.25 x 10^46 ~ 10^47 C atoms on earth^Silicon can form some rings and chains analogous to carbon\\'s, but they tend to be less stable, in large part due to the reduced strength of Si-Si bonds relative to C-C bonds. \\xa0Sulfur can form chains and rings of various sizes but doesn\\'t branch well and also suffers from relatively low S-S bond strength. \\xa0',\n",

[EDIT: possibly it is modeling the \"less likely to get covid\" piece but not \"less likely to transmit if infected\" and \"infectious for less time\" pieces?]\\n\\n\\n\\nIt defaults to a risk budget of 200 microcovids per week, a 1%\\nannual chance of getting covid, regardless of what you tell it for\\nyour vaccination status.  The highest budget it offers is only 10x\\nthat, for people who \"can\\'t avoid risk, but still want to make smart\\nchoices\".  This was a reasonable way of looking at things earlier in\\nthe pandemic, but at this stage I think much higher budgets are\\ngenerally appropriate for fully vaccinated people: the risk to the\\nindividual is generally extremely low and the risk they impose on\\nothers is relatively low.  Altruistically, since most of society is\\noperating on a much higher risk budget keeping to low one is a lot of sacrifice\\nfor minimal benefit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor a vaccinated and boosted person I think a better approach is to\\nuse no budget most of the time, and then use a budget of perhaps\\n10,000 microcovids/week (~50% annual risk) when demand on the medical\\nsystem is likely to be especially high.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEven just the first two have a very large impact.

       " {'text': 'I\\'ve been thinking about out whether I can discover laws of agency and wield them to prevent AI ruin (perhaps by building an AGI myself in a different paradigm than machine learning).So far I’ve looked into the history of the discovery of physical laws (gravity in particular) and mathematical laws (probability theory in particular). Here are 12 things I’ve learned or been surprised by.1.Data-gathering was a crucial step in discovering both gravity and probability theory. One rich dude had a whole island and set it up to have lenses on lots of parts of it, and for like a year he’d go around each day and note down the positions of the stars. Then this data was worked on by others who turned it into equations of motion.2.Relatedly, looking at the celestial bodies was a big deal. It was almost the whole game in gravity, but also a little helpful for probability theory (specifically the normal distribution was developed in part by noting that systematic errors in celestial measuring equipment followed a simple distribution).\\xa0It hadn’t struck me before, but putting a ton of geometry problems on the ceiling for the entire civilization led a lot of people to try to answer questions about it. (It makes Eliezer’s choice in That Alien Message apt.) I’m tempted in a munchkin way to find other ways to do this, like to write a math problem on the surface of the moon, or petition Google to put a prediction market on its home page, or something more elegant than those two.3.Probability theory was substantially developed around real-world problems! I thought math was all magical and ivory tower, but it was much more grounded than I expected.\\xa0After a few small things like accounting and insurance and doing permutations of the alphabet, games of chance (gambling) was what really kicked it off, with Fermat and Pascal trying to figure out the expected value of games (they didn’t phrase it like that, they put it more like “if the game has to stop before it’s concluded, how should the winnings be split between the players?“).\\xa0Other people who consulted with gamblers also would write down data about things like how often different winning hands would come up in different games, and discovered simple distributions, then tried to put equations to them. Later it was developed further by people trying to reason about gases and temperatures, and then again in understanding clinical trials or large repeated biological experiments.\\xa0Often people discovered more in this combination of “looking directly at nature” and “being the sort of person who was interested in developing a formal calculus to model what was going on”.4.Thought experiments about the world were a big deal too! Thomas Bayes did most of his math this way. He had a thought experiment that went something like this: his assistant would throw a ball on a table that Thomas wasn’t looking at. Then his assistant would throw more balls on the table, each time saying whether it ended up to the right or the left of the original ball. He had this sense that each time he was told the next left-or-right, he should be able to give a new probability that the ball was in any particular given region. He used this thought experiment a lot when coming up with Bayes’ theorem.5.Lots of people involved were full-time inventors, rich people who did serious study into a lot of different areas, including mathematics. This is a weird class to me. (I don’t know people like this today. And most scientific things are very institutionalized, or failing that, embedded within business.)Here’s a quote I enjoyed from one of Pascal’s letters to Fermat when they founded the theory of probability. (For context: de Mere was the gambler who asked Pascal for help with a confusion he had.)“I have not time to send you the demonstration of a difficulty which greatly astonished M. de Mere, for he has a very good mind, but he is not a geometer (this is, as you know, a great defect)...” – Blaise Pascal6.In Laplace’s seminal work putting probability theory on a formal footing, he has a historical section at the end praising all the people who did work, how great they were and how beautiful their work was. Then he has one line on Bayes where he calls his work “a little perplexing”.“Bayes, in the Transactions Philosophiques of the year 1763, sought directly the probability that the possibilities indicated by past experiences are comprised within given limits; and he has arrived at this in a refined and very ingenious manner, although a little perplexing.”Also, whenever you feel like you’ve missed out on your glorious youth, note that Thomas Bayes got interested in probability theory in his 50s, and died aged 59. He was not formally trained in math in his youth.7.I watched a talk by Pearl about his causal models, and I was struck by the extent to which he had a “philosophy” of counterfactual inference. It had seemed pretty possible to me he would have said “here was a problem, and here is my solution”, but instead he had a lot to say about counterfactuals and how he thought about them conceptually that wasn’t in the math.It reminds me of my impression that Daniel Kahneman (and Amos Tversky) have strong models of how their minds work, of which the heuristics & biases literature is a legibilized component of, but certainly does not capture the whole thing.Relatedly, in a lecture by Feynman on seeking new laws, he says that some people say “don’t talk about what you cannot measure”. He says he agrees insofar as your theories need measurable predictions, but he doesn’t agree that people should stop discussing their whole philosophies, as the philosophies seem to help some people come up with good guesses about laws.I think in the past I could have found myself unable to justify my interest in the philosophy of something as more than a personal interest. Now I have a practical justification, which is that it helps me come up with guesses about how nature works! And my current guess is that many people who were successful at that had unique and well-developed philosophies.8.Pearl himself says that he has discovered two laws, and once you have them, you can fire him, because the rest is just algebra! And he calls it a calculus of counterfactuals, just like Newton and Bayes and everyone did. Fascinating.I couldn’t find anything on what problems Pearl was thinking about when he came up with his calculus of counterfactuals. Like, was he personally trying to analyze clinical trials? Was he a mathematician who was friends with people doing large experiments and thought the math was interesting? I want to know what part of the world he was in contact with when developing it.9.I updated against expecting to resolve scientific disagreements at the time when the correct theory is known. Let me explain.In the discovery of gravity, there were a lot of anomalies that didn’t fit the data. For instance, Jupiter didn’t follow the law: its orbit was a more elongated ellipse when it was further away. Uranus’s orbit would jiggle a bit sometimes. Also there were two stars who didn’t orbit their collective center of gravity, but instead some other point within the ellipse. At this point I would have been like “yeah, nice try, but your theory isn’t fitting the details”.Want to know what they said at the time? (Spoilers ahead.) For the stars, they said that we were probably just looking at them at a funny angle and that’s why it didn’t work. For Uranus, they said there was an invisible planet that was knocking it off-course. And for Jupiter, they said the light was moving too slowly for the measurements to work out.To me this seems like an awful lot of complexity cost weighing on a theory. Now it’s no longer just a theory, it’s also a lot of explaining exceptions with unlikely stories. The star-angle one doesn’t even seem testable, it gives me a Scott-Alexander-like sense of this explanation gives me so many degrees of freedom that I can probably explain away loads more anomalies with it.Anyway… they were all right.\\xa0From Uranus’s wobbles, they found Neptune. The stars were indeed rotated at an angle. And they did some experiments and found out that light did have a speed and this explained the Jupiter issue, and opened up a whole new area of inquiry about light.Very impressive in retrospect, but I feel like I couldn’t have gotten this right at the time.My update is further in the direction that Jacob’s post The Copernican Revolution from the Inside argues for, which is that if two different people had different theories at the time, I do not anticipate the disagreement being able to be “clearly resolvable” at all, and do expect for it to involve a great number of judgment calls, in large part dependent on one’s “philosophy” of how to make those calls in this domain.10.Feynman has a wonderful quote on the art of guessing nature\\'s laws that includes at least two paths not discussed above. That said I don’t understand them, in particular the ways that quantum mechanics was discovered. (I’m tempted to dig into that some.)\\xa0I’ve put the full quote in this footnote[1], recommended.11.One confusion I wrote down in advance was “I still don’t quite know how to predict that there will not be a simple mathematical apparatus that explains something. Why the motion of the planets, why the game of chance, why not the color of houses in England or the number of hairs on a man’s head?\"Looking back on this, I don’t know whether I got a direct answer, but I now feel that my answer is something like “look for the places where Nature will show herself directly”. Obviously that’s not a very well-specified answer, but I feel like it points to a real distinction.12.I also made an advance prediction: “I guess I also make the advance prediction that most of the rest of the [probability] math was developed by people who liked symbol manipulation more than people doing real-world problem solving. But I would be interested to be surprised here.”This prediction was false! It took both! All the probability math was developed by people who liked using math to reason rigorously about the world, and who were interested in understanding the real world! There were exceptions like Bayes who relied a great deal on thought-experiment, though sort of still “about” the world, not just about symbols.\\xa0When I thought of math previously I thought about my math friends in academia, who just sort of entered the abstract world as a starting point and lived in there. (“My professor does work in flat-spherical-manifold-density-vector-spaces, so I’m trying to prove something there too!“) Now I think of people trying to reason about particular parts of the world I live in, and who are trying to make an externalized symbolic calculus that can do that reasoning for them.Next StepThe natural next step of my investigation is to learn more about how key discoveries in areas like optimization and information theory and game theory were made. How did nature show herself to these discoverers? I have written down a few advance predictions for if I continue seeking this information...^Feynman, on the art of guessing nature’s laws, in his final lecture for BBC\\'s Messenger Lectures:“Or look at history, you first start out with Newton: he [was] in a situation where he had incomplete knowledge, and he was able to get the laws by putting together ideas which all were relatively close to experiment—there wasn’t a great distance between the observations and the test.”“Now, the next guy who did something—another man who did something great—was Maxwell, who obtained the laws of electricity and magnetism. But what he did was this, he put together all the laws of electricity due to Faraday and other people that came before him, and he looked at them and he realized that they were mutually inconsistent; they were mathematically inconsistent. In order to straighten it out he had to add one term to an equation.”“By the way, he did this by inventing a model for himself of idler wheels, and gears, and so on, in space. Then he found what the new law was, and nobody paid much attention, because they didn’t believe in the idler wheels. We don’t believe in the idler wheels today, but the equations that he obtained were correct. So the logic may be wrong, but the answer is all right.”“In the case of relativity, the discovery of relativity was completely different: there was an accumulation of paradoxes; the known laws gave inconsistent results, and it was a new kind of thinking, a thinking in terms of discussing the possible symmetries of laws. It was especially difficult because it was for the first time realized how long something like Newton’s laws could be right—and still ultimately be wrong—and, second, that ordinary ideas of time and space that seem so instinctive could be wrong.”“Quantum mechanics was discovered in two independent ways, which is a lesson. There, again, and even more so, an enormous number of paradoxes were discovered experimentally, things that absolutely couldn’t be explained in any way by what was known—not that the knowledge was incomplete, but the knowledge was too complete!: your prediction was, this should happen; it didn’t.The two different routes were: one, by Schrodinger, who guessed the equations; another, by Heisenberg, who argued that you must analyze what’s measurable. So two different philosophical methods reduced to the same discovery in the end.”“More recently, the discovery of the laws of this [weak decay] interaction, which are still only partly known, add quite a somewhat different situation: this time it was a case of incomplete knowledge, and only the equation was guessed. The special difficulty this time was that the experiments were all wrong—all the experiments were wrong.”“Now, how can you guess the right answer when, when you calculate the results it disagrees with the experiment, and you have the courage to say the experiments must be wrong. I’ll explain where the courage comes from in a minute.”“Now, I’m sure that history does not repeat itself in physics, as you see from this list, and the reason is this: any scheme—like, \"Think of symmetry laws,\" or \"Put the equations in mathematical form,\" or any of these schemes \"Guess equations,\" and so on—are known to everybody now, and they’re tried all the time. So if the place where you get stuck is not that—and you try that right away: we try looking for symmetries; we try all the things that have been tried before, but we’re stuck-so it must be another way next time.Each time that we get in this log jam of too many problems, it’s because the methods that we’re using are just like the ones we used before. We try all that right away, but the new discovery is going to be made in a completely different way—so history doesn’t help us very much.”',\n",

       " {'text': \"Epistemic status:\\xa0exploratoryStudent: Rah, it’s so frustrating!Master: What is?Student: I keep stumbling back into Foucault, and I’m never able to decide if I should discard him or if there’s something in there.Master: I see. Why do you think that he might be irrelevant?Student: A bunch of reasons: people keep telling me that he’s either wrong or outright dangerous, he apparently made a specialty of historical mistakes and biased evidence, and post-modernism seems to always end in denying reality.Master:\\xa0Pretty damning. And yet you still think that he could teach you something?Student: That’s the frustrating part! I have this intuition that Foucault built — or tried to build — some great epistemic tools, and that these could be an important part of the toolkit I’m building.Master: Just try reading him then, and see where that leads you.Student:\\xa0I did.Master:\\xa0Oh. And it didn’t go well, given your look.Student: I\\xa0might have thrown the book in frustration.Master: I see.Student:\\xa0And stomped on it. And insulted its ancestry. And burned it.Master:\\xa0Not reading him directly, then. Or at least not without some preparation. And maybe some anger counseling.Student:\\xa0That’s why I looked for a secondary source after that.Master: Good call.Student: And I found this book: “How to read Foucault”, by Johanna Oksala.Master: How should you read him, then?Student: Well, she does make a case for Foucault as breaking certainties. For example, she writesWhile science and much of philosophy aim to decipher from among the confusion of events and experiences that which is necessary and can be articulated as universal law, Foucault's thought moves in exactly the opposite direction. He attempted to find among the necessities that which upon closer philosophical scrutiny turned out to be contingent, fleeting and arbitrary. For Foucault, the aim of philosophy is to question the ways in which we think, live and relate to other people and to ourselves in order to show how that-which-is could be otherwise.Master:\\xa0But you already knew Foucault’s aim was critical, didn’t you? That’s one of the issue with hardcore postmodernism: overcriticizing to the point of intellectual suicide.Student: Yes, but I wasn’t sure that this was a fair reading. The fact that a Foucault scholar and overall defender says it has more weight than from critics.Master:\\xa0Fair enough. That still doesn’t tell you much about his tools though.Student:\\xa0That’s the other thing I learned about: that Foucault’s main tool was history. He used to reveal where the concepts and necessities came from, and in doing so take away from them their sacred nature of “natural” background assumptions.Master: Hum, so history for finding out where our concepts and values come from, in order to question them?Student:\\xa0Exactly! And the historical path plays a big role in the criticism, especially if they’re here for the wrong reasons.Master: Interesting. Reminds me somewhat of\\xa0Inadequate Equilibria.Student: That’s what I thought! Except the focus is more concrete — when you can beat the consensus — and Yudkowsky depends far more on game theory and evolutionary psychology than history.Master:\\xa0And I guess there’s also similarities with works like\\xa0signaling theory and\\xa0The Categories were made from Man, not Man for the Categories?Student: That’s my guess.Master: Yet all these approaches work well; why do we need Foucault?Student: I don’t know! I mean, okay, maybe it’s that Foucault is more… epistemic?Master: In what sense?Student: Something like “Foucault wants to understand the underlying epistemic changes and breaks”.Master: Wait a minute: that’s something completely different.Student: Oh. You’re right. So there’s two things:The historical contingency critiqueThe paradigm and epistemic changesMaster: Now, is Foucault’s work the content you’re looking for, or merely a pointer.Student:\\xa0What… does that mean?Master: Do you think that you think that the value of Foucault for you comes from the specific ideas he had, or in using him to even consider these two topics? For example, your historical contingency category is related to signaling and inadequate equilibria, but also cultural history. And the epistemic changes that Foucault discusses are part of a more general frame around paradigm, maybe a pointer to Bachelard for example.Said differently: now that you have the categories, is Foucault a central part of studying these categories, or is he at best a minor source in them?Student: Ah! I do feel less drawn to Foucault in particular now that I have these categories; he definitely doesn’t seem the most important source in either, even if he’s relevant. But…Master: But what? Don’t let your confusion hide — draw it into the light.Student: There’s still something about Foucault himself, his intellectual work, that seems important for epistemic purposes. What is it? It’s not about his tools anymore, or the content of his work. It’s… that he made so many mistakes?Master: So you want to learn to not make the same mistakes?Student: No, no, they don’t seem that interesting, as mistakes go. But that’s close. He made mistakes, but… he seems to have found some relevant ideas while making mistakes? Like, it sounds like he’s often factually wrong, but in ways that are not detrimental to his very large scale points?Yeah, he’s one of a few thinkers I can think like thatMaster: Interesting. Who else?Student:\\xa0Gould’s the only one that comes to mind.Master: That’s definitely a can of worms. But I see what you mean: it does seem that there was some productive direction despite the mistakes — and being a pain in the ass, in Gould’s case.Student: Exactly!Master: Still, that’s not something you can do now, can you?Student: Why?Master: Because for that to work, you need to find what Foucault and Gould got right. Which means digging into cultural history and paradigms for Foucault, and levels of selection for Gould.\\xa0Student: Did I just put more work on myself?Master: Yes! I’m proud of you.Student: I should get started then.Master: Sure, when you finish your study on Dennett’s intuition pumps. You remembered to work on that, right?Student: Well… I was kind of bothered by this Foucault thing…Master: Good that we solved it then! Now, let’s talk intuition pumps!Student: Yes master…\",\n",

We already sexually violate them in different ways and abuse them physically, so if you're uncomfortable with dog/bull fighting or bestiality, you should probably be similarly uncomfortable with supporting the meat industryFinally, there's just the probability aspect of this, where even if you're 1% unsure that eating meat is wrong, that's essentially equivalent to a 1% chance of an outcome with over 100 murders/rapes that you've contributed to, which is equivalent to more than one atrocity personally committed by you. It's like if I had a pork company with no safety standards so 1% of the time you purchased my meat you were actually eating one of my employeesHowever, the striking counterargument to all of this that I can't overcome is simply that morals aren't real.

You’re pretty sure they like you, but you really want to know whether they like you like you.You don’t act on this in any particular way, but you do spend the whole next week thinking about it. You think about other people who have been into you, and about people who have not, and the differences between them. You muse about what sort of taste in romantic partners you imagine the person might have. By the end of the week, you’re weighing your virtues and vices, trying to decide whether you’re even worthy of love.(If this seems alien to you, I hope it is at least true to your experiences of some humans.)In the moment when you noticed you were attracted to the person, you made an observation. In the moment when you noticed their smile, you made another. In the moment when you noticed your curiosity, you made another.But as soon as you vanished into your own musings, you were no longer making observations. You were no longer collecting data. Instead, you were interpolating, extrapolating, filling in the gaps with stories and guesses, processing and reprocessing. Everything that followed, in the week after the party, took place inside your map—analysis, interpretation, reasoning, reflection.In Arthur Conan Doyle’s “A Scandal in Bohemia,” Sherlock Holmes lectures Watson on the difference between seeing and observing:“You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”“Frequently.”“How often?”“Well, some hundreds of times.”“Then how many are there?”“How many? I don't know.”“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.”I don’t know how many steps there are on the staircase up to my own living room, either. Setting aside the question of prioritization, and whether I should be turning my attention there—what is it, exactly, that Watson and I are doing with the steps?My guess is that we’ve taken some initial impressions—a few moments of impact from the external world—and used those points to draw a constellation. Every time we walk up the steps, we do almost all of our processing on the constellation, rather than on the points of light in the sky.\\xa0Most of our “seeing” the stairs is happening inside of our maps. We observe just enough to recognize that we’re about to encounter the well-understood “stairs” entity, and then we superimpose our “stairs” concept over whatever sensations are happening to us, and stop paying attention. To the extent that our brains record anything, it’s that we “climbed up the stairs,” rather than that we felt some number of impacts under each of our feet, while the muscles in our legs contracted and our heart rate climbed slightly, etc.Imagine that you do end up asking the cute person from the party to meet you for coffee, but when the day comes, you’re extremely distracted by a disaster at work, one you’ll have to return to as soon as the date is over. Despite a whole hour of conversation, you leave feeling like you’ve learned almost nothing about them.Crucial data was all around you, but while you saw it, you failed to observe any of it.It is hardest to make fresh observations about things you have seen many times. The stairs, long-held beliefs, attitudes you were raised with. The more often you superimpose your drawing of a constellation over points of light in the sky, the more opaque your drawing becomes.\\xa0It probably doesn’t really matter that I have seen-but-failed-to-observe my stairs. I never miss a step, and I’m not in a murder mystery whose solution might depend on how many steps there are.\\xa0It certainly does matter, though, if I have seen-but-failed-to-observe the way I make requests of my child, especially if I haven’t even noticed the distinction. If I believe I’ve observed when I’ve really only seen, I’m much less likely to start paying attention, or to hypothesize that I may have gotten something wrong. If we’re going to be close for a long time, we need to be able to communicate with each other, not just with the cartoon drawings we habitually plaster over each other’s faces.It also matters if I’ve seen-but-failed-to-observe the factors that cause me to continue on my current career path, what I count as evidence, or my default response when my expectations are violated.Seeing-but-not-observing is a failure to make contact with a bit of territory that is right in front of you. It is standing at the bank of a river while staring at the part of your map labeled “river”. Often that’s good enough; but sometimes the river is flooded when you need to cross, and then you really have to lower your map and make contact with crucial data. You have to look at the world itself, or else you’ll drown.In the sentence “Knowing the territory takes patient and direct observation,” this is what I mean by “observation.” I mean actual contact with the territory. Looking at the stars themselves, instead of letting the constellation fill your mind as your eyes glaze over.Knowing the territory takes patient and direct contact with the territory.In the next two essays, I’ll talk about two ways of being in contact with the territory: directly, and patiently.\\xa0\",\n",

This should take under 10 minutes, and you don't need to read the rest of this post beforehand—in fact it would be great if you could fill out the form right now.\\nIntroduction\\nI want to get an idea of how much demand there is for a university-independent organization that manages a compute cluster for academic AI alignment groups and independent researchers. Currently I don’t know anybody who is willing to run such an organization, but if demand is large one could either actively look for people to run such a project or find an existing organization that is willing to take it on.\\nMain idea\\nNon-industry AI safety research organizations have a hard time procuring compute. Groups spend many researcher-hours on managing servers on a relatively small scale. Common obstacles are 1) having to deal with university bureaucracy (e.g. regarding hiring, engineer wages, and procurement) and 2) missing out on economies of scale.\\nProposal: A university-independent organization that provides access to compute for academic AI alignment research groups as well as independent researchers. Such an organization could pay high wages for its engineers (compared to academic labs) and benefit from economies of scale.\\nPotential benefits\\n\\nTime saved: currently, researchers spend time applying for compute grants, setting up and maintaining servers, and setting up software environments after switching between systems. Easy access to large amounts of compute would avoid most of these time costs.\\nExpanded capability to do research: a centralized organization could afford to manage larger compute clusters than those usually used by individual labs. The difference is even larger for independent researchers, who might not have access to large-memory GPUs at all.\\n\\nPotential problems\\n\\nGatekeeping: just like with other resources such as funding, deciding who gets access can be hard and risks becoming a political problem. OTOH, subject-specific grants are common / accepted within academia. Still, management of access would have to be done carefully.\\nDemand: some groups have access to large university clusters and may not need this service. I’m currently uncertain about how large the demand for this is.\\nLeadership: even if it were clear that this is a good idea, I don’t know of anyone who is willing to run this project. This seems like a solvable problem though, once we have a clear idea of what the demand is.\\n\\nForm\\nIf you haven't already, please fill out this form about how much extra compute might accelerate your research (<10 mins).\\n\",\n",
